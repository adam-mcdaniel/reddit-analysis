This means no photographs, no edited cartoons, no AI generated images, no templates, no memes and no image macros. OC is allowed, as is animation.\n\n 3.

There is no room for error when handling classified materials.\n\n* Trump *CLEARLY* mishandled hundreds of classified documents.  But as a former president, the national archive simply asked him to return them.  Yet he refused.  \n* They told him that they would be left with no choice but to prosecute him.  He still refused.  \n* They got a court order and he returned a few documents but not all of them.  \n* They told him they were preparing charges and he lied and said he had no classified documents.\n* Finally, left with no choice, the FBI executed a search warrant and found hundreds of extremely sensitive documents.  \n* Worse, they also found several empty HUMINT folders.  Disclosing this information means assets **die**.  \n* Several empty SIGINT folders were also found, which, if disclosed, would mean the loss of valuable signals intelligence assets.\n\nThis, by itself, is a very criminal act.  You can disregard everything else he did--and it is a long list--but this is enough to convict him.

Carson extended Trinity Lutheran’s principle of religious antidiscrimination to its outer reaches, affording religion something of a superstatus seemingly above that of race or sex. **It is no longer acceptable for a state to seek neutrality on matters of religion by separating itself from religion. The state must instead open its doors to religion and accommodate various religious adherents’ personal interests and pursuits, even when they conflict with those of the state, undermine public education, and threaten equity for traditionally disadvantaged students.** The Court has all but invited individuals to bring free-exercise claims any time public policy occasions some inconvenience for those individuals’ religious interests.\n\nLong ago I went to a Christian high school for a year (I'm now old).  It was a military-style school, and very expensive.  As plebes, we were punished when we didn't yell loudly enough. The only exception was when we were dealing with another plebe, we were not required to yell at them.  Any other person, a student who was no longer a plebe, or school employees, we were required to yell, wall-shaking and ear-ringing loud until they told us not to yell.\n\nAs an adult, I've learned that yelling loudly can be illegal.  Bosses will even become physically-violent wage thieves when you yell at them as we were taught to do at that school.
