I would find myself getting jungle gapped quite often and then having to pull back their lead by stretching the game out for me to scale. Overall, it's been interesting trying to learn jungle, but I think I'll stick to other roles in the future.\n\nADC being the 2nd least popular role also makes sense because it requires some knowledge of wave states and usually has some pressure on their shoulders to perform and do lots of damage. I've used Carfilly as a way to learn other ADC's that I wouldn't be as confident to choose on my main, but I will still try my best and improve for next season!\n\nToplane was my biggest fear coming into this challenge. I enjoy playing top lane champions but find that being left alone on an island to fend for myself is something I don't thrive at. I picked up Nasus in an attempt to just sit in my lane and scale for later which seemed to work most of the time!\n\nSupport is good fun. I always flirt with the idea of role switching since my mechanics aren't as good as my peers in higher ranks, and I enjoy the gameplay of support quite a lot. So, this role is a big thumbs up from me, really enjoyed playing it but just wish it was more common in Fill Queue.\n\nFinally, the lonely Mid game. I had one single game of Mid all season and I lost it quite convincingly. I didn't have many champions at the start of the season to choose from so I just went with someone easy, but sadly couldn't pull out a win. Maybe next season I'll get another chance to play mid and bring home a W.\n\nAnd thus completes our Season 2022 challenge.

We looked everywhere (patch notes, jungle item description, riot-released videos) but couldn't find an explanation for getting less XP. After doing some testing we found that jungle base experience from camps was reduced across the board.\n\nI will include the spreadsheet of test we did here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NGrh6dZWNx\\_LMAvOCrJsOURdmqp5c0M1Bauv2bEr0j8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NGrh6dZWNx_LMAvOCrJsOURdmqp5c0M1Bauv2bEr0j8/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nTLDR;\n\nJungle camps give less experience at higher levels compared to before preseason. At the maximum camp level (when the average game level is 9) you get 4% less XP from clearing jungle camps. **This wasn't mentioned anywhere in the patch notes.** This feels especially bad because solo lane XP got buffed this patch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Pets and Treats**\n\nAdding to that it says in the patch notes, you will feed ur pet one treat when: \"1 treat per large monster/champion takedown\". On this current patch, you will NOT get a treat when you score a champion takedown.\n\nIn the jungle item text in-game, it doesn't say you will get a treat when you score a champion takedown.\n\nAnother point is that when you click on the jungle item in-game it says you get a treat every 60 seconds when ur pet is fully evolved. This should however say 90 seconds, you do get the right amount of treats in-game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gold from clearing**\n\nGold calculations are included in the spreadsheet above.\n\nTLDR;\n\nGold in preseason is about the same, a lot of the gold you would usually get from full clearing is compensated by the treats. This also means that junglers who didn't fullclear before get more gold on average now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you have any feedback feel free to add to the discussion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCredits to Methylfenidaat and ScienTrist for the research\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit 1:\n\nPreviously said 8% and 5%, math was wrong on wolves XP, fixed now. Added scuttle crab aswell.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit 2:\n\nAfter comments from Riotphlox the mystery of the jungle XP has been solved. Apparently what happened in the preseason patch is that 15XP from camps was moved from base XP to bonus XP. With the way camps work (base XP\\*1.35 (at level9)) (different multiplier at other levels).\n\nThis means that for example the wolve camp which had 95 base XP which would give 95\\*1.35 = 128.25. Now gives (95-15) \\* 1.35 +15= 123 XP. (bc this 15 XP is now bonus XP).\n\nWhich means all jungle camp scaling is nerfed as unintended side effect of the change which wouldn't let laners take ur camps in early game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;","score":389,"comments":[{"body":"Looks like most of the XP dif comes from krugs, buffs, and wolves.

As a baseline, Champions pretty much gain 2 Armor for every 1 point of MR per level. So, you just get a lot more armor passively than MR. There is only one exception to the rule, which is Thresh, as he does not gain Armor per level due to his passive.\n\n2) Armor is just much easier to come by in the shop. You can fit a Cloth Armor into a lot of important items as a fighter, tank or even a mage. Armor Boots, Bramble Vest, Deadman's Plate, Sunfire variants (they give MR too but armor is still easier to buy just because its 150 gold cheaper), Death's dance, etc... These are all items that you tend to buy first or second. Death's dance is a prime example of this. Mages can always buy Hourglass.\n\nMR on the other hand, is again, harder to fit in. Spirit Visage used to be the go to default MR option for both tanks and fighters (you could argue Hexdrinker/Maw, but you weren't going to buy that over Sterak's unless the enemy was literally 4 AP or something). Tanks nowadays have FoN but Spirit Visage is still a competitive buy a lot of them with Healing/Shield capabilities.\n\n---\n\nAn additional point is that MR is also harder to mitigate in general. There are very few raw Magic Pen items in the game. So, getting even a single big chunk of MR item (usually a value of 130 or more) will make you much tankier against targets with no Magic Pen, and you will remain that way untill they start getting Void Staffs. Hell, if you get a tank with 250 MR or so, you are strictly unkillable against certain champs, even with Void Staffs and whatnot.\n\nArmor doesn't work that way. AD is usually applies through a consistent damage source, rather than pokes or spell rotations, so you will still die as long as someone is hammering on you, just a bit slower.","score":3,"comments":[{"body":"It's less value  in terms as u only need 1 magic resist item to counter magic dmg dealers  and be able to 1v1 while for armor u'll be getting 2 generally so the chance of this item being picked up is very unlikely  \nAs a tank u are also way less likely to be facing magic damage dealers.  \nMost armor items that have hp stat also have around 50 so I wouldnt really say 50 magic resist &gt; 50 armor","score":1,"comments":[]},{"body":"That’s not true. You first need to understand the design, and why everyone has better scaling armor stats.\n1. Every champion can do ad damage, but its not true for magic damage. It is especially relevant early game as aa is a big part of every champions laning phase. Armor will reduce damage no matter what, but mr might not.\n\n\n2. Esp in higher elo/competitive 5v5, having 2 sources of magic damage is very risky, esp mid-jg. The reason is simple: merc treads. Its the only reliable item that gives you tenacity (yes some mythic passives can give you some but nowhere relevant). This is why when drafting, you see more physical damage overall but paired with cc (often support). You may ask how does that one item so impactful? Its because its the most accessible defensive item that can be built on anyone except adc: you will reduce the snowballing effect by a lot. As a counterpart, magic pen is also more accessible to ap champs compared to ad champions.\n\n3. There is almost always an ad dps source in the game, but not for ap.\nThis is why adcs are so weak early game: their damage comes from the fundamental mechanic of any champion: auto attacking. Which is not restricted by ressources like mana or cooldowns.\n\nSo no, mr is not more valuable than armor. Do you naturally have more armor than mr in the game? Yes.

The police(investigator) gave their opinion as \"guilty\" for this one; however, it is up to the prosecutor to finalize this process - so it's too early to call it guilty. This is usually the time to know(for petty crimes) whether it's guilty before going to the prosecutor, but it could be reverted by the prosecutor him/herself. Also, if the case is too complicated, it might go to the court for a proper trial.\n\nIf this case has started from the police station and not from the prosecutor's office, then the investigator will pursuade the plaintiff not to proceed further or just end this case directly at their office if it ever were to be not guilty. However, if this case has started from the prosecutor's office, then the case must be returned to the prosecutor after their investigation and must include their opinion - whether it'd be guilty or not guilty. I highly doubt that if it's the latter, then it's just a signal to say 'hey look this over' and not 'hey this is effin guilty.'\n\nTLDR: me thinks, judging from the title, if the investigator gave \"guilty\" as their opinion, then the prosecutor might find it guilty as well.

That's the simplest rule.","score":1,"comments":[]}]},{"title":"Biggest surprises and differences for Dota 2 players coming over to learn League Of Legends","not_safe_for_work":false,"locked":false,"body":"I've coached a LOT of league of legends players trying to jump over into dota 2. The games are very similar, and many skills and tactics transition over very cleanly. As I learn about League more and more, play it, and watch tournaments, I've concluded that, moreso than champion skills and item knowledge, there's just some core aspects of League that Dota players find veeery strange when first encountered.\n\nSo, here are the top 6 differences that surprise players coming from dota into league. I plan to make this, and the sister topic, into videos soon.\n\n1. Aggro rules of minions and turrets.\n\nMinion allegiance in League is way stronger than in Dota. Whereas in Dota you can bully enemies in lane with spells without ever drawing creep and tower aggro, in League, turrets will go berserk if you even sneeze at an enemy champion. Oh, your uncontrollable cleave accidentally clipped my friend? DIE MOFO! Also turrets will not drop aggro of you until you become untargetable or leave their range, and juggling turret aggro is way more of a dance than it is in dota. Lane minions also get mad when you hurt their friends, but their aggro resets way faster and they won't chase you out of lane. Also, minions LOVE hitting turrets, to the point that they will entirely ignore your champion if there's a juicy turret for them to suicide to instead. Minions will also never aggro to jungle creeps, and generally stay in only the lane they spawned in. No more creep escort missions.\n\n2. The jungler is a required role.\n\nIn league, the jungler is a valuable component of any solid line up. There's lots of gold and exp in the jungle, and some champions excel at killing the jungle camps even from level one. It's not that the jungle creeps are that much easier to kill, it's that there's a special early game item that expedites your farming power in the jungle, and makes you grow stronger the more jungle camps you clear. In addition, jungle creeps in League do not actually have spells, so there's no fear of a camp spawning a skeleton army to slaughter you and your family with. There are also major objectives in the jungle, such as Dragon and Herald, mini versions of roshan that grant major bonuses to your team. The jungler, with the Smite spell, is the most well equipped teammate to secure these highly contested objectives.\n\n3. Trading in lane.\n\nAbilities in League can cost low mana, or no mana, but almost always you can use quite a few of them in lane before your resources run dry. Since you can't deny creeps or get them to suicide onto the jungle camps, one of the major ways to win the lane is to bully the opponents out of it. this means, more often than not, that you are better at dodgeball than the other guys. So many spells in league are linear skill shots with low cooldowns and low mana costs, that laning can end up looking like an anime rendition of your favorite elementary school sport.\n\n4. Ability power.\n\nIn dota, the general flow of the game is that mages, especially supports, are strongest early game since their raw spell damage and utility is unmatched until people can tank through it. League on the other hand, has almost every damage, heal, shield, or effect somehow scale with stats you can gain through item purchases. For physical damage focused champions, when they buy damage, they also increase the damage of their abilities, not just their autos. For mages relying on magic damage, they can buy items with the stat Ability Power (AP) baked right into the item! Want more damage on your nuke? You can buy that! In fact, you are EXPECTED to buy that. Going off meta, buying ability power when your actives scale with attack damage, is often considered griefing. This means that a way smaller variety of items are viable on your selected champion, regardless of the role you are playing in!\n\n5. Lanes and roles are structured.\n\nThere is always 1 top, 1 mid, 1 jungle, 1 carry, and 1 support. deviating from this is a heresy in League. Not only that, but supports tend to shadow their carry for a large portion of the early and even mid game. There's no expectation for you to roam early as a support, and instead that responsibility falls more on the jungler and mid than anyone else. As for the top lane, League players call it \"The Island\" for just how isolating it feels to play in that position. Regardless of match ups, you generally never see any sort of lane swaps early into the game, and laning phase lasts what feels like ages, sometimes even until the first tier 1 turrets fall! So, if you think your champion that you are playing as ADC is a hard counter to their top, still you are expected to play bot until forced out of lane. If you swap to go top, you might get reported.\n\n6. Summoner spells and passive items.\n\nIf you enjoyed having items with magic immunity, or blink dagger, of illusions and invisibility on demand, so sorry to say but you won't find that here. Instead, almost all powerful items in League are passives that augment your damage and defenses, with sometimes a nice passive utility bonus on the side...which is usually just more damage and defenses. Instead, say hello to summoner spells! Now, rather than having to buy purge, blink, and teleport, you can get them from level 1 by selecting them as starting skills during champion select. Sure they are much weaker than what you are used to and have insane cooldowns, but they don't take up any item slots which is nice. The game is balanced around the most powerful of these abilities, \"Flash\" aka Blink Dagger's younger cousin. The range is small and the cooldown is absurdly long, but as a compensation, it can be used while in combat to dodge around like Goku. If you start the game with the WRONG summoner spells, you will get flamed just like if you buy the WRONG items. People can get really into the micro optimizations in League, so be careful.","score":0,"comments":[{"body":"SMH you forgot bottle courier for unlimited spam in mid lane","score":1,"comments":[{"body":"that's not been in the game for half a decade...","score":1,"comments":[]}]}]},{"title":"[Sources] Bjerg &amp; Closer to play for 100T in 2023","not_safe_for_work":false,"locked":false,"body":"[Sources] Midlaner Bjergsen 🇩🇰 will play for 100 Thieves next year.\n\nThis change was anticipated by Travis Gafford, however both parties have now reached a verbal agreement.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/LEC_Wooloo/status/1594054029910237184\n\n_____\n\n[Sources] Jungler Closer 🇹🇷 will remain on 100 Thieves roster next year.\n\nOther teams considered the player over the course of the offseason, one of them being SK Gaming.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/LEC_Wooloo/status/1594056317467066371","score":3396,"comments":[{"body":"Really hyped to see how Closer and Bjergsen duo would work out.

Thus, pushing the support role somewhere else on the map? \n\nYou can technically do this now without the whole pet idea but then you get reported for trolling. 😒 But sometimes your ADC is a lost cause 2 minutes in…\n\nIdk, interesting idea that would require a lot to change but just a fun “what if”.","score":1379,"comments":[{"body":"i am a toplaner, and i also want a pokemon","score":1522,"comments":[{"body":"We have the enemy jungler as a pokemon.

In fact, people start calling NA the \"retiring home\" as there weren't many new players raised locally. The LPL is experiencing a similar problem. \n\nPDD, a former LPL pro and former owner of YM LDL, said on stream recently that it is IMPOSSIBLE to produce new talent. No matter what, players can't play professionaly until they are adult. This means that they gain significantly less money + experience. \n\nThe worse part, according to PDD, is that young talented players refuse to play professionally because average pros make less than \"陪玩\"\\[duo queue booster\\] and paid actors - inting streamers in high elo. \n\nNot to mention that the many pro players playing at LDL tend to match-fix their games. At least two LDL team has been disbanded this year due to involvement in match fixing. [https://ol.gamersky.com/news/202208/1506623.shtml](https://ol.gamersky.com/news/202208/1506623.shtml) \n\nKeep in mind that Bo self-reported for match fixing. He could no longer play in LPL, but his “庄家” dealer was never caught/punished. In fact, one of the suspicious dealer of LDL match-fixing \"翼锋” is still very active on Weibo. This suggests that LDL may still have some match fixing going on. \n\nLast but not least, there are more people who watch LPL than playing League in China. Normally this is a good thing. But the fanbase are very toxic and unforgiving in China and Korea. Usually some of the fans who don't play league will blame a scrapegoat for the failure of the players they are cheering for. This means that new players are discouraged due to flame and pressure from the media. Young and talented players receive the most flame because they haven't build up a fan base, even if they were not the problem of losing matches. \n\n For example, 2022 TES. \n\nThey changed more than 5 players in year, 369-&gt; Zoom -&gt;Qingtian -&gt; Wayward; Tian -&gt; Xiaopeng -&gt; Tian; Yuyanjia -&gt; Zhuo -&gt; Mark. Half of the above players are from LDL and only Wayward remain. The roster change itself is a Shitshow, compared to 2021 T1 this is so much worse. Such a rapid change is due to the pressure of the toxic fan base of a certain ADC on TES.\n\nWithout solving the above problems, it is unlikely that LPL will catch up to LCK.","score":546,"comments":[{"body":"PDD is a huge name in the LDL scene btw.
