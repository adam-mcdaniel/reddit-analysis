Not sure it's legible in the image.\n\n*Growing up in a small, mountain town in the heart of northern BC, Canada, I have always been enamored by traveling to quiet, remote places far off the beaten path. The places where landscapes are spectacular, culture is preserved, and stories are plentiful. It was this sort of adventure that I sought, and far up in the misty highlands of Ha Giang, Vietnam, I found exactly that. I rented a motorbike and set out on a month-long road trip along the steep and windy roads of the high limestone mountains home to endless rice terraces.*\n\n*My goal in photographing this northerly region was to create images that convey the dignity, beauty, and strength of the people I met along the way. I wanted to share their stories and show the majestic yet challenging environment in which they live. For every smile, every Google l Translate conversation, and every fond farewell, I am forever inspired by and grateful to the people of Ha Giang.*\n\nIf you'd like to continue seeing my work from Vietnam, you're more than welcome to check out my Instagram and website. :)\n\nIG - thecraigschultz\nWebsite - craigschultzphotography.com","score":17,"comments":[]},{"body":"Great photos.
