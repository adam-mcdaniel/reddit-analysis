The idea that just breathing is helpful makes me even more mad I’ve never seen any helpful advice on how to control anger. I’ve only ever seen, “just breathe” “think of something peaceful” “relax and realize why ur angry” what a fucking joke when I get angry I have enough rage that I’m almost positive if I had a gun I would’ve blown my fucking head off anger isn’t controllable, the notion that trying to understand it and stop is completely absurd when I’m in that moment I’m unleashing something idk what it Is I have no control or care of what happens. So just breathing or trying to understand why isn’t gonna help idgaf why I’m mad or if it has an effect the only way to release is to physically hit something I can’t do anything ab it it’s deeply rooted in me I couldn’t pull it out unless it was diffused with a bullet that’d shred apart everything inside of me","score":37,"comments":[{"body":"Agreed. Going to a therapist once a week or month so they can tell us to just breathe and picture our negative thoughts going away is bullshit. Sending us home to our environment where we are out of control an hour later is also bullshit. \n\nThis is the advice I give everyone with any problem including anger. If one day you have nothing tying you down and nothing better to do, sign up for a Buddhist retreat. They're 100% free. You basically get to get the hell away from the world for an entire week and the entire time you have room and board and are taught how to meditate from someone who actually knows what the hell they're doing. No religious bullshit, just 100% paying attention to you for 7-10 days. No work, no school, no traffic, no bullshit from family, friends, companions, and therapists, just a place to go to learn how to actually calm your mind and no one telling you your \"session is up\" and sending you on your way with the same confusion you had before. You can go pretty much anytime you have a chance to even afterwards and for the rest of your life so long as you are there to sit and meditate and leave all the other shit behind. Most people don't even know about this option or even avoid it because of their religion-phobia, yet are still 100% willing to let psychotherapists teach them a watered down version of the Buddhist practice \"Mindfulness\" and it's not even close to actual Mindfulness practiced in Buddhism. It's not just about breathing and changing the cognitive thought process. That misunderstanding is why people shoud be learning from Buddhist teachers not these western psychologists who want to be famous authors and sell books. I come from a family of angry people, my mother yells when she's angry, yells when she's happy, yells when she just talks. My dad yelled all the time too. I've been angry since I can remember, from smacking around kids on the playground in elementary school to even now, being a mom and raging out once a month. But I can tell you this, I am 70% less angry than I was since I started studying Buddhism and coming to these realizations that it has taught me and I didn't even have to sit on my ass and focus on my breathing once to get me here. I just learned to have insight, that's what meditation actually is, not sitting and breathing a certain way or picturing balloons with bad thoughts popping, for fucks sake. I hope this helps you or someone out there. Don't give up, keep seeking and learning.","score":20,"comments":[{"body":"Wow.

My family members argue a lot and then that probably clouds their decision making which in turn clouds my own. I got mad at my mom yesterday over the littlest thing and was really trying to provoke her into arguing with me. It’s stupid. I used to be verbally abusive to her at one point which I regret deeply and make sure I don’t ever get to that level of disrespect ever again because she doesn’t deserve it.

I dunno.  Maybe it’s both.  I’m pretty sure I have changed since then though.  Better at understanding others perspectives and less ridiculously emotional.\n\nYou ever get that thing where youre angry because you know someone is making a mistake and you’re trying to help but they won’t listen.

In a way, anger is a way of coping with other emotions, it’s just not a healthy one. The therapist told me to recognize when I was getting angry and identify *why* I felt this way. Whenever I felt myself getting angry I would take a step back and change my environment. \n\nI would go to another room, step outside, or go for a walk, and then breathe. After that, I would journal. At the beginning it was mostly gibberish, I was so angry that you could hardly read anything I was scribbling on the paper, but over time it got better. “What emotions am I feeling *besides* anger?” “What made me feel this way?” I would ask myself these questions and work through it on paper. \n\nSometimes I would write so much my hand began to hurt, but by the end I had already began to calm down some simply because I was putting energy into something besides just being pissed off. Once I was finished writing I would go over it, reading my own thoughts and analyzing what I felt when I wrote it and how I felt reading it after. It helped me identify the root causes of my anger. I would then look inward to figure out why the root causes were making me so angry. It wasn’t easy at first, and usually required looking back into my past to see what the first memories I had of feeling that way were and how that related to how I felt in the present when those feelings popped up. \n\nIdentifying the other emotions that caused the anger and working through them was incredibly beneficial towards managing my anger.

It depends if said kid is given tools to manage his emotions while growing up, and also depends on his life as a whole (violent family, school problems, bullied, etc.).

I was the same, but I’m a lot less angry than I was two years ago and I get less angry all the time. \n\nI don’t have any specific recommendations because I’ve been in therapy this whole time and my therapist has been helping me through my issues. May I suggest though, that knowledge is power and control: the more you get to know yourself the more you’ll be able to understand where your anger is coming from, and once you shed a light on it I promise you’ll be less angry. \n\nListen to podcasts, read books, watch videos, not necessarily on anger but about human emotions and the way we relate to others. I have read a lot of relationship books because my marriage wasn’t in a good place, but I have learned more about myself than I ever knew was possible through my relationship, couples therapy and relationship books. I keep learning about myself and discovering depths and emotions I didn’t know I had. \n\nSometimes the things I read are things I just understand on a logical level. But when I read something that really clicks emotionally, when I feel like it’s written just for me, that’s when I get my *aha!* moment and realise *wow, so I’ve been angry because I’m ashamed of this thing I’ve been doing, but instead of talking about it I lash out at my husband.*\n\nKeep learning what drives you. You don’t necessarily have to learn about anger specifically. May I recommend Brene Brown’s work on shame and human connection? She recently published [Atlas of the heart,](https://www.shortform.com/blog/how-to-deal-with-negative-emotions/) and has released a [5 part series talking about emotions](https://brenebrown.com/hbo-max-presents-brene-brown-atlas-of-the-heart/) on HBO max. I’ve watched 4 of them so far and every single one has made me cry. \n\nI’m also reading [Nonviolent communication](https://www.amazon.com/Nonviolent-Communication-Language-Life-Changing-Relationships/dp/189200528X/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?adgrpid=53575097222&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA4OybBhCzARIsAIcfn9ngQmMK2UuPn9fIhQUiPrQnumHJnW0ywL6myXQS6wYOTS5_dMw_VoMaAi4VEALw_wcB&amp;hvadid=617134252013&amp;hvdev=m&amp;hvlocphy=9021723&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=11756527639469190365&amp;hvtargid=kwd-298654489587&amp;hydadcr=15148_13597721&amp;keywords=non-violent+communication&amp;qid=1669057557&amp;sr=8-1) by Marshall Rosenberg as recommended by my therapist. I opened it to flick through before I started (I have a lot of books that sit and don’t get read…) and the page that it fell open on was something about judgemental communication and making snap judgements about what’s happening instead of just observing (like “he’s talking way too much it’s really annoying” vs just “he has been talking about this topic in depth for 20 minutes”). We all make snap judgements and the way we relate and communicate with people is affected by that. I started the book straight away after that. \n\nEven learning more about my adhd has made me less angry. I was diagnosed late and don’t have very good coping systems. But understand why I did the things I did also made me less ashamed and helped me identify where I needed help. Still learning to ask for that help but I’m getting there.\n\nAnother thing that helped me was an aha moment in therapy. My therapist said something like “you know that you can feel angry, and allow yourself to feel angry in the moment, and then respond without letting that anger control your response.” I remember sitting there thinking, wait… WHAT. Feelings and actions are two separate things? I can *feel* angry but I don’t have to *respond* angrily? This may be really obvious and it may be something you already know, but to me (last Christmas when I was staying with my parents and every single thing my mom did filled me with rage) it was a revelation. I had a remote session with my therapist because I felt like all the progress I had made was completely unravelled by going back to our family home and I was angry constantly. Then she hit me with that. \n\nSince then I’ve been able to do something that was previously unthinkable (and I didn’t even realise it was a thing): when my husband and I had an argument or disagreement, I was able to take stock of my feelings and *while I was angry* I was able to say in a calm voice, “when you did xyz that hurt and it made me really angry.” \n\nThis [podcast on emotional management](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0V53rtWTTtVFW0mxneyKYM?si=9P1W3gpyTVikINJvzTsfEg) really helped cement that for me, that you can feel your feelings but not react to them. **I previously thought that I had to learn how not to be angry, which felt impossible. I have now learned that I can be angry, let that wash over me, and allow my actions to not be angry.**\n\nI have lots of additional Brene brown talks and videos I could recommend and other books that have helped me along the way, but I don’t want to overwhelm you (or you may struggle to find time to read, or you might just hate Brene Brown) though I’m happy to share if you like. My first intro to her generally was when YouTube auto played some compilation with snippets of her talks while I was doing something else, it was something lame that I would have NEVER clicked on like “Top 10 tips from Brene brown that will change your life forever MUST WATCH!!!” But some of the things she said in that compilation really touched me so I went and found the full talks. And then I cried because I realised how sad and ashamed and scared I was behind all the anger. That I wanted love but I was just pushing people away. \n\nI’ll leave you with this though. She said something in a podcast I listened to recently (it was a podcast on [What to say to get what you need](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4r3wkFRCumKVmi16oYisrg?si=RwvoKofBRNSNrC8dgDNYkg) but it was the the focus on connecting with other people that got me—also something I wouldn’t usually click on because the host sounded a little nuts when I googled her and was into astrology, yes I pre-judged her and then it turned out to be really helpful…) \n\nShe said that our connection with other people is directly correlated to our connection with ourselves. We can only connect with others to the extent that we are connected with ourselves. If we know ourselves, our emotions, what’s driving our anger or our hurt, then we can connect with others on the same level. If we are angry and we don’t look inside ourself then what hope do we have connecting with others?","score":4,"comments":[{"body":"Will definitely look through the resources you have spoken about and see if it’ll help.

Even when I was a child, anger was always my first negative emotion to fall back on, and this is still true today. \nEven though I've always been angry I've never actually been agressive against other people, its more like this interior frustration that usually stays inside.

A big cane corso, that's well behaved, full of love and looks so cool. \nAnd there's this other thing, people call a dog. \nIts a cockapoo, and it drives me mad. \nIt was badly behaved when i got here, because it was allowed to do anything it wants, because apparently people find it cute, and if you're cute you don't get told off.\nIts a bit better now cause put time and effort into teaching it to behave. \n\nI try my best to treat both dogs the same, but i can't. \nEverytime it comes near me i have to stop my self from being aggressive against it. \nI just want to grab its neck and bite that mf. \nI sometimes tell my self, if i saw this in the wild i would definitely eat it.

It’s all anger and shame and guilt and who knows what else under the surface. I would challenge you to keep asking why until you get to the end.  “Example: Why does this dog evoke aggression?

Being annoyed is a major trigger within us because somewhere along the line we found out you can control our surroundings through the dominance that we know as violence. The problem here is that the consequences we face are so outstretched, that it can take one moment to snap, but years in a prison system to get punished for. A question you have to ask yourself is, if you havent acted on these urges because you fear the consequence or because you know deep down that its wrong to challenge something that cant fight you back. Its my take from this post that you KNOW without a doubt that its wrong for you to harm a defenseless animal. Your frustration stems from not being able to control the animal the only way you know how, and that is through dominance. HERES WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW. Hurting that dog wont teach it anything, you will simply frighten it, but that little doggo brain isnt intellectual enough to understand WHY its being punished. This is a major realization in the fact that unless you kill the fucken thing, that very same behavior is going to continue. What  you can take from this comment is that positive reinforcement does wonders for EDUCATING the dog on new behaviors. Infact being a good manipulator will make the dog WANT to behave better rather than doing it out o fear that you will hurt it. FINALLY, i would like to give you an option that some may say is inhumane, but is critical. And before i give you this information DO NOT BE A FUCKING PRICK AND ABUSE YOUR POWER. Shock collars. Shock collars come with remotes that will allow you to control the voltage, THEY ALSO COME WITH A WARNING BEEP. after three warning beeps and the behavior continuing THEN you may administer a shock. the dog will definetly react and after the short shock they animal will look at you, but they will not be able to logically blame YOU for shocking them, this leads the animal to associate the warning beep with being shocked. Over time the dog will learn that \" when i do something im not supposed to, the beep comes on, and i keep doing it, i get shocked\" and the dog will therefore opt not to do it. This is 1000% more effective then hitting the dog because fear distracts from the whole lesson.

It may be worth asking yourself, are there painful experiences from your past that might be subconsciously affecting you on a daily basis?

Anger can become an automatic response to certain situations, and others may reinforce this habit if they have become used to us getting angry.\n• Fear. Anger can be felt as a response to situations that we fear will overwhelm us if we do not go on the offensive.\n• Shame. Anger can spring from the feeling that we have to fight to preserve our dignity and sense of self-worth.\n• Loss. Anger commonly accompanies the sadness which goes with a bereavement or a severe setback.\n• Lack of assertiveness. If we cannot speak up for ourselves and negotiate, we may find ourselves exploding instead.\n• Low frustration tolerance. We go on the attack to deal with situations that most people would just put up with.\n• Response to past trauma.

She’s missed school and hasn’t left her room unless she eats or uses the restroom. I lay down with her and she annoyingly got up and tells me “You only cuddle with me whenever it’s convenient.” I asked what the hell does that mean because Im not sure where that came from. This isn’t something out the blue. When I’m feeling down she’d come in my room to cuddle or keep me some company and vice versa. She tells me “You know”. I ignored it because I didnt understand why she would say that. \nShe grabs her towel and tells me im gonna shower. She goes in the bathroom, comes back and asked me “Will you clean up that puddle of water that you left when you took your shower. I don’t understand how you can be so lazy.” I didn’t know I left a puddle of water and I have no problem cleaning after myself. But her calling me lazy, the feeling of being rejected and her attitude angered me. So I got petty and told her “I’m lazy? If that puddle bothers you so much, clean it.” We go back and forth. She calls me names.\nI tried to calm myself down by going into the living room but she follows me and tells me I’m gonna use your towel to clean it up. That just sets me off. I go into the restroom and grab both my towels and stuck them in the laundry room so she wouldn’t use them. At this point I’m shaking because i’m so angry. I’m hyperventilating trying to calm myself down. Tears are rolling down my face on how angry I was. She follows me into the laundry room to grab my towel all while calling me names. So I pushed her. I pushed once more and then I hit her in the mouth. She drops everything and goes into her room. I got in my car and drove around for a bit. I came home and she’s gone.\nThis was last night. I called her and texted her apologizing. She took her location off. I love my sister so much and I feel like I destroyed our relationship over something so insignificant.. She’s my best friend. I wish I cleaned the damn puddle up and left it at that. I understand if she wants nothing to do with me, hell, I want nothing to do with myself.","score":19,"comments":[{"body":"So I’ve been where you are. I too have hit my sister. I outright traumatized her and she still has mild PTSD from it, years later, even though we’ve made up and are on good terms. I had never done something close to it, and never have since. It is the worst thing I’ve ever done and I still can’t talk about it to anyone beyond my therapist (aside from having addressed it with my sister precisely once). My partner has no idea and never will as far as I can tell, because I am so incredibly ashamed. \n\nI don’t say this to shame you - indeed, as I write above, I understand this more that I wish I did - but you ARE 100% at fault for your violence. The moment physical violence comes into play, nothing that happened before - no fault of hers before - matters. I say all of this because the only way this comes to a resolution you might be happy with, is if you take full responsibility. And as someone who has been where you are, I will not absolve you of this horrendous thing. This needs to be a wake up call and it doesn’t become that if people are soft with you. That being said, just because you did a bad thing doesn’t make you a bad person - you now have an opportunity to show how good you are.\n\nIf you try to apologize but make excuses - such as “well you were being rude” or “you were being passive aggressive” - then you haven’t fully understood the gravity of your actions. I’m glad you’re already to the point of understanding your relationship may be irrevocably changed forever, as evidenced by your understanding she may want nothing to do with you. Sounds like you aren’t making excuses which is good.\n\nSo what are your steps forward? For one, therapy, maybe even psychiatry. Everyone, and I mean everyone, can benefit from therapy, but especially someone with anger issues, who has violated the physical safety of a loved one. Get in, be 100% honest about what you’ve done, even when it feels impossible, and figure out what threatened you so much *on a base level* that you resorted to violence. It wasn’t just her rejection in that moment, or the name calling, or the towels. It was something that threatened your very understanding of yourself, and you need to find out what that is so you can fix it. This goes for the psychiatric possibility too - do you have deep-seeded anxiety that is feeding your anger, where medication can help you? Something else?\n\nAs for your sister, you give her SPACE. You can send maybe one more text, stating you know you were unequivocally wrong, you’ll be seeking to address your anger through real therapeutic work, and you understand that all trust is gone. That you won’t reach out again, as you understand further contact that isn’t on her terms could further damage her. Then you leave it. Forever, if need be. Anything after that would be in the effort to make yourself feel better, and be another strike towards her (even if small and metaphoric).\n\nBeyond those immediate things, you should also consider what wider changes in life you need to make to transform or mitigate your anger. Maybe living with your sister isn’t healthy, even if you make up - are you possibly codependent where her rejection of your cuddling is too much? Is living with other people in general too much? Do you need to spend more time on your own being “selfish” and not soothing other people when they seem down? Do you need to develop more independence and identity through a move or new hobbies so rejection doesn’t cut so deeply? A therapist can help with all of this. The larger point is, simply cleaning up the puddle next time (or whatever next times equivalent is) isn’t going to solve your anger and it wouldn’t be a guarantee that something like this doesn’t happen again. You need to make really changes if you want to never make this mistake again. \n\nNow, for the final bit: don’t let this eat you. I’m so sorry for the pain you’ve caused not just for your sister, but also yourself. But mistakes - even awful, horrible, unimaginable ones - happen. You are human, and you are worthy of good things, if you do even a little work at being good. Grow and be better.

You can look at what the causes are later after you get through the moment. Don't let the moments go by unreflected upon. Once you get through it, try to walk yourself through why it happens. Then have compassion for yourself even if you were in the wrong in some way. Treat yourself how you would treat a friend and listen to what you let your voice say to you about how you should feel in the situation. You can feel however you need to feel, just know you are loved. If you don't think someone loves you, this crazy person thinks we are all connected. There are a lot of things that can contribute and some are within your control. Focus on those things. While it is happening, I recommend you walk away. It doesn't matter where you are going. Walk until you aren't quite as steamed and then head back. You need enough power to get back. If you go too far, you will be exhausted. Of course, returning exhausted is not a bad idea either. If you can't do that in the moment you can do a number of things but they have to be meaningful to you. You have to be honest. When you are in that state what will calm you down? Maybe you don't need to be calm. You could play drums or an instrument. You could go lock yourself in a bathroom and drone or ohm. Play something soothing in the background and assign your anger to an inanimate object. Stare at it, yell at it, talk to it....Talk to yourself and it and keep it separate from you for a while. Or you could float out of your body into space and look down on yourself (in your mind's eye) \"See that person down there on that tiny planet? See what's happening in their life? See how they feel right now? Okay, you are going to go inhabit their body and help them out.\" Boom. You are a new iteration of you. (PS, if you become a whole new person in one day, here's another tip, don't let anyone tell you who you are based on what happened yesterday. When we are new, we are simply new. People around you need time to get used to the new you before they stop acting like they know everything about you) You can decide how to handle the situation. If the habitual body of the husk you just inhabited wants to cling to old ideas say \"that's okay body, I got this for you. You don't have to do that this time\". .........Maybe I sound crazy. You asked. That's what worked for me. At my lowest, I picked a number and looked for everything to do with that number. You do whatever is meaningful to you.

Exercise can really help with that (even if it's just tensing every muscle - not to the point of cramps! - and then release) I like Chi Gong as well. Also, interest! If you are interested in something or there is anything in your life you wish to cultivate; that can lead you to a life of purpose and fulfillment.

Rather than focus on changing everything all at once instead be patient and try to do a little better everyday.\nIt sounds like you’re really hurting right now, you’re feeling pained and from what you’ve said it’s poured into your day to day life. You have to be really honest with yourself and ask what is it that’s hurting me, why am I feeling hurt. This can be painful because we don’t want to revel in our hurt. When you’re honest with yourself and what’s bothering you, you have something tangible to work on and work through. \n\nIt sounds like your partner isn’t aware of what you’re going through.

Anger like this has a root that can run very deep and it will continue to spill out to those you love the most. You don't want to lose more friends or scare your gf into leaving you. A cycle of anger and guilt is sometimes very hard to break, certainly on your own. You will hate yourself more with each outburst and your guilt will feed that shame again into more anger. It will not just stop on its own and it will probably get worse with time. To be frank. There are no simple solutions here. You can go running or do yoga or whatever, it might help a bit, but in my case that didn't fix the issue at all. My anger stems from a deep root stretching all the way to childhood, its impossible to fix something like that quickly. I went looking for therapists after I snapped at my gf and felt the urge to hurt her. Previously my anger would only spill out in certain stressful occasions, like traffic for example. When my gf suddenly became a viable target for some petty reason I realised something was very wrong and it had to stop. I was scared of myself and my feelings, I hated how I felt my control slipping away, how angry thoughts would consume me. That insecurity about my own behaviour just fed into more anger and in that way it really is cyclical, at least it is for me. Anger, depression, shame, guilt and anxiety took over and made it hard to be in any kind of relationship. Safe to say I didn't like the person I was becomming one bit. After several I found a psychiatrist and a therapist that suited me and seemed very capable. I was not very fond of medications either but decided to give them a try. They actually gave me a lot of space to work on my anger issues. I gradually felt more in control again, less angry.  Learn how to communicate bounderies in an assertive way, there are ways to control or divert your issues into a more healthy coping mechanism, map out triggers and become aware of the underlying root of the problem.

Even if I have a proper chat or somewhat address what's brought on these feeling, I often still have this itch. Smashing dinnerware has often been a go to. There's something about breaking things that helps dissipate that energy that would otherwise linger for the rest of the day and keep me up at night.\n\nObviously it would disturb the people around me so I do it in private. A common example would be that I'm making a cup of tea at home. That tightness in my jaw comes on, I get the urge, I smash the mug I'm holding on floor, wipe and sweep it up and move on. Later, when my family finds the pieces of an otherwise useful mug etc. in the bin, they're understandably displeased and concerned.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy question is:\n\n1) Is it okay to lean into this outlet for anger? Can I just let myself smash stuff or would this lead to other problems?\n\n2) If it is okay, I would want to do a proper set up. Instead of smashing whatever useful things I have on hand, I would much rather have some junk bric-a-brac sitting in the backyard and safety googles.

Obviously don't have much to offer but im similar to u in that destruction can be the best way to let go of built up anger as a starting point.\nI genuinely don't see anything wrong with this as a coping method provided u plan it out first, just like any other coping mechanism. So maybe breaking things in ur daily life isn't the best approach (iv broken alot of things i care about this way myself and still struggle not to bite phones when they won't work) as it's not necessarily helping u to practice important things like riding out the urge and self soothing techniques. These are important because u wont always be able to express urself physically in the moment, so u need a plan for times like that as well! \nAs for things u can do in times where it's safe and ur able to, i have a few ideas but that's really what i was looking for myself as i don't currently have alot of these options/they aren't what i need.\n\n-My parents always taught me that punching sofa pillows is useful because u can get anger out while being productive (it plumps the pillows up). U can genuinely go ham on those things tbh coz they're huge and tough and need alot of work. Depending on the outer material u might want to protect ur hands but leather sofas have always been the best for this\n-loved ur idea about slashing old tires! Just really make sure u can be safe and have a level of control doing it (cut resistant gloves are a god sent). U really could do this with alot of old junk, footballs, cardboard, dense foam etc. Try to pick things that are decently sturdy (reduces chance of slipping) but not so difficult to cut that ur gonna break the blade/tool or have it get stuck\n-breaking down packing materials like cardboard, polystyrene etc is great for things like ripping, stomping, jumping\n-on a smaller level, breaking pencils has been a good one and also one that's easier to do in regular situations\n-gardening and cleaning are both hobbies that require alot of physical force, i mean if uv ever had to scrub years worth of grease off of a cooker door with steel wool lol\n-diy as a hobby as well or just going to town on junk/scrap wood with a hammer/axe \n-throwing heavy stuff! This is actually used as a workout but u can buy weighted balls specifically designed to be thrown (watch a tutorial to make sure ur form is safe, protect ur back) \n-literally just screaming/shouting at the top of ur lungs, words, noises whatever (try to make sure ur out of the way to avoid a poor neighbor making a worried call to emergency services)\n\nIn general it's good to figure out what type of physical action it is that seems to work for u or that u feel strongest and look for creative ideas based on that. Remember that once uv allowed ur body to let go of the emotion, u might then still need to mentally let go of it after. \nTalking about problems and analysing them is helpful but u cant really work through emotions on that alone. Emotions are felt mentally and physically and u also need to allow ur body to process them and relax.

Lately, that has not been the case at all and it's beginning to frighten me. In the last two weeks, he has lost his temper and yelled at levels and places I have never seen in my 27 years with him. He lost his temper at the mechanic who was screwing around with us and then began giving him shit and raising his voice at him. It was very unusual, I have never known him to lose his temper like that at a stranger in public in front of others. Then it happened again at another mechanic a few days later. Tonight, he was screaming at my mom in a way I had never seen before in my life. He actually kicked the couch and smashed his glasses on the ground while screaming at her. It was shocking, I have seen them fight but I had seriously never seen him yell as loudly as he was. He never hit her and I don't think he was ever going to or would do so, but I got very scared and I wasn't gonna leave. After it was over I gave them both hugs and he told me he was ok. I told him I had never seen him like that before and he told me people change as they get older. I didn't know how to respond to that. The common thing between all these encounters is that these people frustrated him first and supposedly my mom was the first to raise her voice, but I have never seen him deal with his frustration like this.\n\nTwo notable things have happened recently that has coincided with this change in behavior. Firstly, he got laid off from his job and is currently unemployed. I knew he wouldn't be at his happiest without a job but I have never seen him reach this level of toxicity. Also, he randomly yelled at me while I was driving. He used to do that when I was younger but I lost my temper at him when we got home and told him that he didn't get to talk that way to me anymore.

I feel very much taken advantage of by both. My so called friend is a guy I have known for several years. In the beginning I never questioned his friendship but for the past year at least I have. My so called friend seems to have a double standard when it comes to our friendship and a sense of entitlement and self righteousness. For example, it’s okay if he doesn’t respond to my phone calls or texts but I had better always be available. Or, the fact that he expects me to show up and support him at his events etc. Yet, when I need support like when I had surgery he is nowhere to be found. He also expects me to drive us around including paying for parking whenever we hang out all the time. Then, he expects me to get him jobs wherever I have worked. He also refused to take me to pickup meds I needed after a recent surgery because he didn’t like the location. He also places boundaries on our friendship when I don’t do something he says but disrespects my boundaries if he decides they are not valid. \n\nMy narcissistic ex relationship was a total user and jerk who preyed on my vulnerability. Yet, he seems to be flourishing in life at times in my eyes.\n\nI said all of the above because I am pissed with both people. Usually, I try to be the bigger person and just distance myself from those who I feel aren’t good for me once I come to my senses and stop making excuses for them or I stop ignoring red flags. However, in this moment I really want to say profane things to both. I have this overwhelming urge to physically attack my so called friend and my narcissistic ex should I see him again. I keep imagining the things I would like to do to both. Part of which includes public shaming of them around people that matter to them. I suspect that whenever I speak to my so called friend there’s a real possibility I may blow up at him. \n\nDoes my anger sound justified or am I possibly overreacting?

Whenever I persist and try to maintain my stance he’ll just argue his point or whatever fits into his narrative. As for the example of me paying for parking he typically feels justified because he thinks I have money and can spare the expense. I don’t have excess money. There are so many other examples I can give of him. Like the gross fact that he several times has come to my house and tried to get in my bed in his street clothes. He wouldn’t stop when I told him not to and it took me to say something to gross him out to stop him. \n\nAs for my ex relationship he liked to gaslight and worked to convince me I wasn’t putting in enough effort in our so called relationship.

However, I never said that it’s impairing my daily functioning. It is true that I tend to be a loner with not many close friendships.

Though I am actively re-evaluating that so called friendship and at the moment really no longer consider him a friend unless something changes dramatically. \n\nOtherwise, I actually do get along well with others like in my work relationships or my other 2 friends. In general I am easy going. But, I actually consider this to be a fault because I have difficulty setting and reinforcing boundaries with others as I find myself always giving others the benefit of doubt or I try to not hurt anyone’s feelings. Lately, I’ve felt very taken advantage of and disrespected especially by my so called friend. While he dismisses my feelings whenever I raise a concern with something he says or does towards me if he decides I am not entitled to feel a certain way. \n\nNo, I think I am far from a narcissist. My wanting to make the people I referred to in my post feel public shame is because I know they value their public persona and status. So, my urge is just to hit them where I know it might hurt them the most so that they might experience some inkling of how they’ve made me feel. In general I actually feel tremendously hurt by them because at some I had trust of them. So, that makes me feel so invalidated, stupid, and shame of my own that I thought they valued me as I did them. So, yes it makes me very pissed and wanting to lash out. As I stated in my initial post I normally take the high road but this time I kinda don’t want to. \n\nI am already in therapy and one of the issues I am addressing is my not setting boundaries with others when I need to and actually sticking up for myself better. So, again I think your speculation of my being narcissistic is incorrect. I’m just angry at this point but it definitely does not hinder me in my functioning.

Why do you get overwhelmed easily? For example, is it due to lack of control? Is it because of the people around you? Is there a lack of boundary somewhere? And when you answer the question, you don't have to stop there. Another \"why?\" can be asked to the answer you find. I find that learning a little more about oneself helps with coping mechanisms. \n\nThere are many reasons as to why we feel anger and they are all valid.

If something new has to get added then something has to come off. \n\nThere are a lot of apps that help manage tasks and your time. I don’t know your specific issues , but maybe using some tech to manage your time and schedule things out might help. I’ve noticed sometimes when I see all the crap on my calendar or list I r makes me want to trim it down and I quickly realize what’s important and what’s not. \n\nYou can also hire people like virtual assistants to help you with tasks. If that’s it an options maybe you can delegate things to family and friends, especially the ones that benefit from what ever needs to be done. \n\nThat brings me to another issue which is learning to be assertive. If people are overwhelming you in some form or another it may be best to tell them to back off especially when you start feeling overwhelmed. This may take practice because you may be irritable and they may argue with you. So be careful not to blow up.

Or just keeping you stuck in a fight from two years ago? It could be both, or neither.

If that’s the case, whenever the anger arises try to remind yourself that you aren’t trying to dwell in the past anymore and that you’d like to let the anger go and move on.

You have every right to feel how you feel and when you think of it, hopefully it becomes more like an acceptance type of thing… like say the thought pops up and you can start to think “that fight made me really angry” but you can also understand there’s nothing to necessarily do about the emotion. It just is. You don’t have to meditate it away, although meditation definitely helps you recognize what you’re thinking and feeling in the moment…. But my point is hopefully you can start to let the thoughts about the fight pass by you, recognize that you don’t like what happened and it’s something that causes you anger, and let it be. \n\nI think a lot of times these things won’t go away because we want to change what happened or change how we feel about it.

I was never satisfied until I got back at the person who was the cause of my anger and stuff like that. Also had really bad road rage.\n\nThese days I'm much better but I'm in a situation where I'm having a very hard time keeping it under control and could use some advice or tricks to just let it go.\n\nI'm an automotive enthusiast and I love my car. I bought it back in 2014 and it was my first brand new car. My parents helped with purchasing it because I graduated with honors from university. So it has a lot of sentimental value beyond me valuing it as a material possession.\n\nA couple days ago I was driving along in the right lane and a big old 80s Dodge pickup with dually wheels, like quite a big truck, decided to change lanes when I was right beside it. Keep in mind I recognize this truck - that's an important tidbit. I hit the brakes and laid on the horn but they kept coming over and they were right about to side swipe me so reflexively I moved over to the right a bit more but of course I hit the curd. I got them to pull over to which she came up with various ways to blame me and called the owner of the truck who just said 'well these things happen'. No apology or anything like that.\n\nDamage wise I definitely need an alignment and both my passenger rims are completely curb rashed all the way around.\n\nRemember how I recognized the truck? The neighbor directly behind me has a daughter. She was driving the truck and the truck belongs to her husband. They're currently living in her parents' basement.\n\nEvery single day I see the house and I see the truck and I think about what happened and everything and it makes my blood boil.\n\nI've talked to my neighbor across the street from me who is a cop and he said legally nothing can be done since I don't have any witnesses and my dash cam plug broke when I was moving and dropped a box on it. So no proof to serve her a ticket of any sort. Going through insurance isn't possible since there was no actual collision between the vehicles. Going through my insurance will just raise my rates and hurt me in the long run.\n\nThere's no course of retaliation or anything. I should have let the truck just hit me but fighting reflex kicked it.\n\nSo I keep bouncing between blaming her, blaming myself and her, and purely blaming myself for deciding to go get groceries.\n\nSo all of this backstory is to ask, how can I keep myself from spiraling into pure anger and rage everyday about this? Short of building a giant wall between the houses there's no way I won't see the house every day - dining and living rooms have big windows that overlook the backyard and subsequently, the house. Master bedroom and bathroom are also at the back of the house so the house is visible from those windows as well. Right now it's still fresh but I can't seem to let it go. We just moved here a couple months ago and I fear that every day going forward is going to suck because I'll see that stupid house and ugly truck and spiral down the rabbit while again.\n\nI may have went a bit overboard on the details but I feel it was all necessary to understand exactly why this situation is angering me so much.","score":2,"comments":[{"body":"Man, I understand where you are coming from.\n\nIt’s like, you know they are wrong, you just want to punish them for being wrong!\n\nBut you’ve got to let it go.

Sometimes it works in your favor, sometimes it hits you, your family and close ones. Not to mention the fact, that lots of people are attributing it to the experienced trauma in the past. \n\nI have the opposite problem, and I understood it by accident about 8 years ago. I was having a meeting with a psychologist and she asked me, what do you do when you get angry? I was like, I don't know, I don't get angry, for me anger instantly dissociates into disappointment and sadness.\n\nIt was even more obvious back then, since my flatmate was a guy who could go into full fight mode over everyday things. We were cool with each other, but I've seen him ready to throw hands with people over parking spots or someone cutting in line in a shop. The way he stood up for himself really impressed me, since we were pretty much the same size, but it was like he had a spark that would make him go 0 to 100, which was completely alien to me. The spark, however, came with a price-tag. His parents were like a kryptonite to him. I can hardly recall a phone call he had with his mom, that wouldn't end up with him yelling at her and hanging up. When his pops called him, I could see how miserable he was. It wasn't like his parents were physically abusing him when he was a kid or something, but I also knew very well he had little to be grateful for, which obviously was oblivious to them. \n\nHe wasn't the only one like that. My uncle, a very direct, hot-headed guy, who would never step away from confrontation, when trouble came around his way, became so depressed he was barely leaving his bed for 6 months. My other uncle, never taking a step back, but also full time regular alcoholic, could disappear hitting the bottle for months. My pops friend, confrontational in a matter of seconds, but in reality a miserable recluse. Oh, I would forgot. My flatmate's father, who I described earlier, was exactly like that. Ready to raise hell anytime anywhere, but when dark clouds came around, he became full-blown suicidal insomniac for a year. \n\nMy behavior is pretty much the opposite to those people I mentioned above, and I hate myself because of it. It's a struggle to stand-up for myself. Some of you mentioned literally being blinded with rage when stepped on, disrespected, insulted. Since I remember, my natural reaction is to pretend like I didn't hear it and if it's not possible, act like they didn't mean it. Smile, laugh, play it down. If it's obvious they meant disrespect, ignore it, it's not like I'm not spending the rest of my life with them. If situation goes to full confrontation and someone acts aggressively, I will still try to defuse it. I even got patted on the back couple of times for \"acting maturely\" or \"you're such a calm guy, nothing can faze you\". Few months ago I was working as a security at a concert and someone said to me, \"man, you're good with people\". But there's also the other side. \"Next time tell them to get the fuck out and when they don't, make them\". Now, there's value in peace and staying calm - as long as you can get violent and fight when it's needed. \n\nAnd it's alien to me. It's not like I could choose anger, but decided to stay calm. That would be something to take pride in. Worst part is, I am not unfazed. Everytime it happens, I wish I lashed out and went full postal on them. I wish I reacted, I wish I called them out, I wish I started yelling and knocking shit over. I wish I was ready to raise hell over it. I wish they took me for a psycho than for a coward. But I didn't, and all of those times, are literally boiling in me, making me depressed and disappointed that I let people treat me that way. \n\nObviously, the way people are, once they sense you will not stand up for yourself, you are a target. I had people disrespect me, act cold towards me, yell at me, take me for granted only for the fact that I'm trying to keep myself to myself and stay out of their way. I can't count how many times I wished I had someone else's temper and went full ballistic. Funny thing is, people will hate dealing with a person who has anger issues, but at the same time, they will hate even more someone who is shy and timid. You can't win at life having anger issues? Well, you won't win being a monk either. Oh, also something important. A few rare time I stood up for myself, when people see you are ready to go, their behavior changes in an instant. Once I stood up to a friend of a friend who made some stupid remarks about me, he became super respectful and tried to befriend me for the rest of the evening. Few times I checked my dad, and he was very apologetic, said he got carried away. While working security, I had a drunk guy wanting to fight me, when I said whenever he's ready, he started dapping me up and wanted to buy me shots. \n\nMy point is, I just thought it's ironic how a lot of you are suffering because you can't keep yourself from lashing out and going full rage mode, but where I come from, it would be nothing short of a superpower.","score":11,"comments":[{"body":"Fear, hate, rage, all the same thing.

You can be strong without getting angry.\n\nYou seem well adjusted, but look at anger with rose-colored glasses for some reason. Anger NEVER solves anything. Let's say someone takes your parking spot that you were waiting on. You can explode at them, scream at them, assault them, assault their car, etc. None of that gets you the parking spot. None of that \"teaches them\" any lessons. Some people are assholes, and they aren't worth your time to \"correct.\" Sure, you MIGHT be able to scare them into moving... but now you get to worry about them doing something to you or your car later. \n\nOnce, while driving to work, someone cut me off on local streets and almost hit me. I yelled at him through my car window, and he spit on me through the car windows. I blocked him off and confronted him. He was still yelling at me, but rolled up his window. I was in blind rage mode and punched out his window. He got out and in my face, and right when I thought about punching him out... I realized there was a crowd of folks staring at us and, if cops got involved, I was likely to be arrested. Luckily, I snapped out of it and realized I got myself in deep shit and ended up giving the guy $100 for the window and just left.\n\nNow I let things like that go. However, if I'm wronged and there IS some recourse, I stand my ground. Look at customer service calls as an example. I bought a device that was missing parts, and the company refused to help when I first contacted them. While I could have yelled, it would have done nothing. Instead, I explained the situation again and I reiterated that it is an unacceptable for them to do nothing when it's entirely their error. By being calm, yet firm, they ended up going out of their way and shipping me the missing parts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Anybody can become angry - that is easy, but to be angry with the right person and to the right degree and at the right time and for the right purpose, and in the right way - that is not within everybody's power and is not easy. - Aristotle","score":3,"comments":[]}]},{"title":"what do you do when you had a horrible upbringing and suddenly turned into a \"monster\" a \"jerk\"?
