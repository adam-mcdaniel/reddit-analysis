For 2, future prio for invades on future stacks. Also scuttle crab is more important because it has more exp into it in season 13 than season 12, so getting the push level 2-3 advantage mid lane so your jungler can double scuttle is massive and easy to do with Syndra.

My goal would be to shut him out of the game. If I lose the sidelane, the game will be very hard for my team. So I’m taking Ignite over TP because I’m not confident in my ability to win the matchup (especially if he takes ignite). I’m likely relegated to sidelane duty anyways, and since I really just need to win lane this game, it’s superior to TP.\n\nLevel1: I’d be sure to be on my wave level 1 and walk with it to lane so that he can’t zone me if he bush camps. He’ll have to tank the wave if he wants to get a trade off.\n\nLeve2: My trade pattern level 1 will be AA+W-&gt; retreat through my minions. My goal is to deter him from all-inning and get level 2 first. E is my second skill up. If he tries to trade/all-in, AA+W+E through him towards tower. Second E will (hopefully) gain enough distance to keep me safe. On the flip side, if I’ve found enough free damage Lv1, I could force a level 2 all in with a 50rage AA+W ignite.\n\nLevel3: I’m now using AA+Q to harass any time he tries to last hit. I want to be careful not to push too hard, so I won’t Q if it means a lot of AoE minion damage. I’m trying to position to avoid this and maximize the time for a slow push. If lane is going in my favor, it will be pushing towards Tryn and I’m opening myself to a gank topside after full clear. I just need to be careful and make sure I’m warding properly. If I feel comfortable, I can commit AA+W+Q for a solid trade, retreating into my minions to create space with my CDs down. I can also utilize just an AA+W, but W is a key defensive tool, so I need to be careful when it’s down. He should have to commit E if he wants to trade back after I use W, and I can use double E to escape/buy time/avoid damage if necessary. At this point I’m looking to get as much damage as I can into him so I can try to all-in before level 6. Once I get a kill, this lane is much easier.\n\nAfter any trade, I need to be careful of his W. Any time I combo and retreat, I stutter step when the CC ends to predict his W. Lots of trynds will be spamming it to cast as soon as the CC ends. Once they realize you have a brain, it becomes a bit of a mind-game. If he lands W, he can potentially run you down and kill you. May the bigger brain win.","score":20,"comments":[]},{"body":"A note: gold doesn’t matter of they haven’t actually backed.

I’ll break it down as best I can. \n\nIf you are a tank &gt; you typical build a core item (was sunfire/frostfire often) and then you build around what champions are in the game based on your goals. I’ll list some mock situations.\n\n- enemy team is playing AP top and mid, you start building a magic resist items\n- enemy has 2-3 cc abilities, you can build merc treads for tenacity which reduces cc time\n- enemy has all AD champs, you build armor\n- enemy has 3 ad champs, but they are all behind and only the mid lane ap is strong, maybe you build magic resist to deal with them better, since the AD champs are behind and weaker. The win condition here ideally is to shut down the enemy midland whos AP. \n\nThis applies to all roles, except with what your goal is on your champ. Here are some more examples:\n\n- you want to scale so you build items to help you survive lane/ farm minions (lifesteal, armor, mr, etc.) this is based on matchup of your lane opponent and your champ \n- you are adc and build randuins last item because you have enough damage and you cannot avoid all damage in a fight. (Some damage can be unavoidable)\n- you’re playing a bruiser who can splitpush, so you build hullbreaker and avoid your teammates. \n\n\nIf you can follow this logic, often you can figure out items that will fit your game. However you will still need to understand and learn the game states. Like if you build MR to teamfight but still have to lane for a while and get crushed against AD opponent, then that probably was not a great build path.","score":5,"comments":[{"body":"","score":0,"comments":[]}]},{"body":"It depends on a lot of stuff, and mostly on situation you find yourself in, and what you need during match... and for that it takes some time to learn champions and the game itself.","score":2,"comments":[{"body":"Yeah I can tell that’s why I don’t mind watching a long YouTube tutorial but everything I’ve seen so far has been close to useless","score":1,"comments":[{"body":"","score":0,"comments":[]}]}]},{"body":"Other folks can help with item tips but if you see someone else do more damage with a build than you seem to do it might be because of champ levels.

Her Q is a projectile that causes true damage on the way back. W are orbs that attack nearby enemies and give her move speed. E is where most of her quit is, it charms the enemies and is very useful to set up her combos and picking enemies. \n\nCombos: What I used o do the most was to wither down my enemies using Q. Once they were in killing range I'd ult/flash casting charm, followed by Q W and ignite. Not using her charm is also very useful, just the threat of using is useful to control choke points.\n\nSkins: I bought 2 skins for her, Arcana and Coven. They are both sick, but Arcana's recall is one of the best B's in the game.\n\nBuilds: I build, Everfrost if we needed a CC machine, it works really well to set up her charm and vice versa.

Minion advantages are very hard to overcome during the very early levels which means the first wave is hyper important for the next 2-3 minutes.  \n\n\nIf your junglers path opposite (enemy starts bot) there are ways to pull wave, or again if youre getting to manipulate wave you can attempt to crash w2 allowing you to bounce back waves 3-5 which makes your positioning on lane considerably stronger in terms of you being able to get ganked during the timer gank timer of 250-340.

Something that helped me go from Plat to Diamond was not forcing bad engages trying to \"make plays\". Fizz's champ design is all about forcing an engage with an enemy that is incapable of winning the all-in. Fizz's weakness is in only having very specific opportunities to punctuate this, contrasted by most of the game where he gets clobbered if he forces a bad play. Fizz heavily rewards you for being a patient player, waiting for the lane/jungle/powerspike state to favor you. \n\n2) Fizz is highly punishing when you go for CS that isn't yours to take. You have to walk up and have no spells to really threaten a trade or take CS with, so it is very obvious if you are walking up to last hit a minion. \n\nThis means you have to consciously sacrifice minions throughout lane, or else you get chunked.\n\n3) You are horrible from behind, and will have a really bad time if you playing poorly. You will have to learn the full weight of all-inning when you're not supposed to.\n\n4) Your waveclear spell is also your escape. This means you have to very carefully choose when to try to hard push the wave, and you will get punished if you do it without knowing where the jungler is.\n\n5) Fizz is not very mechanical to pilot if you're plat+. There are a few wall hops that you can mess up (e.g. wraiths, blue buff). However, there are some small mechanical things you can learn on him to play him more efficiently. For example, when returning to lane, you can save a second or two by perfectly hopping through towers. Any decent riven player knows this.\n\n6) His build path is very situational, so you have to actually pay attention to what the comps are, how the fights will go, etc. E.g. Liandries vs Protobelt, when to rush zhonyas, Lucidity boots vs Sorc shoes.\n\nHopefully these explanations make sense. Some of the concepts are a little difficult to articulate.

Also, don't be afraid to use abilities to farm, especially for the canon.","score":3,"comments":[]},{"body":"This is a fundamental of laning, here are some tips that should help you, in order of importance:\n\n1. In keybinding settings you can tick a box that says \"show attack range\" (google how to do this if you can't find it). This makes it so that when you use the default binds for attack-move (A or X on the keyboard are the defaults) it will show your champions auto range in a circle around their model. This is important when you're learning a new champion.\n2. Going off the above point, once you can see your range, try to always last hit from your MAXIMUM range. This is a great habit to be in and keeps you from overextending. It makes it harder for your opponent to mess with you when you're using your champions range advantage near perfectly.\n3. Assess if you need to stand in the wave versus outside of it. Against someone like Ezreal who's main spell is blocked by minions, you want to stand in the wave so he can't hurt you with his primary spell. Against someone like Vex you want to stand outside the wave so she can't hit both you and your wave with the same AOE spell (make her choose between pushing and harassing). It gets more nuanced as you learn the match ups. Against Xerath you want to be off the wave because of his Q, but behind at least 1 minion because of his E. Against Lux you want to be behind 2 minions because her Q has a passthrough. Etc., etc. The core lesson here is try to understand whether you want to be in or out of the wave and then stick to that for how you position your champion in the lane.\n4. Auto attacks take time to fire (some worse than others) and if you are ranged they will have travel time (with a few exceptions on champs that have whip-like autos like Vel'koz and Azir). Take this time into account when you last hit, sometimes you have to fire your auto off before the minion is in the kill threshold because it will get low enough as your AA missile approaches the minion.\n5. Try to layer the minions so they have different HP values as they die to keep their deaths staggered. When minions are dying 1 at a time it's much easier to last hit them compared to when they're dying at the same time.\n6. You have to feign last hits. Your opposing laner, if good, will try to harass you when you go for last hits. That's when your champion is locked into an attacking animation and ripe for being hit by skillshots and other attacks and abilities. You both know this so you need to do some feinting. Walk up early to a last hit, then walk back, then duck in and out again. Start your auto and cancel it and walk away. As a melee a common one I do is walk up to a melee like you're going to last hit it and then keep walking instead of stopping to auto. The point of this is to bait out abilities and harass but dodge them in the process. If you lose the last hit but bait an ability, that's a fine trade. Imagine you're trying to CS as Fizz under tower and you bait out the enemy Ahri's charm by feigning a last hit on a melee minion. Now she lost a lot of pressure you will have a much easier time farming for the next 8 or so seconds. This is also a good trick if you want to kill the enemy laner, fake a last hit to bait an ability and then once they've missed it all in them. If you watch vods of any high elo player on youtube you will see everything I described in this point constantly by both laners. That's the core fundamental dance of laning, getting last hits while outplaying your opponent through feints and then harassing them on their last hits without getting baited yourself. Better laner wins.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLearn the above and that will get you really far in terms of CSing. Remember it's a matter of practice, this will be hard to do and you will probably fail repeatedly for like 80 games.

(long post) - An Analysis","not_safe_for_work":false,"locked":false,"body":"This post was mainly targeted at WHO to play and why, rather than HOW to play -  This post assumes you have more than 1 hero pool lol, or are looking to understand which pool of heroes you should invest in.\n\nI see many people asking \"which carry is the best cause my team is bad\" or \"which champ has the best earlygame so I can snowball, I don't care if I fall off lategame!\"\n\nI say this because I feel if you play towards a specific role, your going to run into the same issues of getting countered... but just at a different \"phase\" is the game.\n\nMy best way to explain this is to think of the game in phases - 10-25 min, 25-35 min, and 35+, and try to understand which champs \"peak\" at which phases. And also which phase peaks \"counter\" the other.\n\nThe graph on this post represents this VERY well - [https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/p00ee8/champion\\_win\\_rate\\_vs\\_game\\_length/](https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/p00ee8/champion_win_rate_vs_game_length/)\n\nSo looking at this graph, any sharp changes in the graph represent a powerspike or drop off. try not to necessarily look how high the peak is.\n\nAnd there are many many different patterns as you will see, but if we simplify it into phases, youll see like darius, morgana, leesin, nidalee have the potential to **snowball early**, but if they dont, they fall off a bit, but still have good team presence. some however, drop off ALOT more than others (upper right graph of pyke elise and tahm kench)\n\nThen you see Champs like annie, karthus, malz, shyvana, zilean, liliana and viktor having amazing **midgame** presence. Reasoning is that they spike INTO this phase, have some solid counterpush, or they are very very good at picking off champions and dismantling deathballs. Zilean provides exp that builds up to a lvl 11 spike after deathball, similiar to viktor.\n\nFinally you see the \"**carries**\" the phase that you talk about which **retain their strength or improve in the endgame** when everyone else is falling off. Teemo, Nasus, Ornn (item advantage AND tank), Rengar, kayle, veigar, amumu (insane CC and tank). Why do tanks scale well? Because they dont die! death can be a 50 second penalty or even worse a game loss! And you might be shocked to see Rengar here, but hes an assassin early, then midgame ppl tank up, and hes still building items so he cant burst, then lategame hes full slotted and back to one shotting the dps! classic 60 40 60 curve! There are also many flatline champs in the group of azir, which wont really excel but also wont really fall off in the midgame or lategame. I believe this is because the lack the tankiness and CC, or insane burst damage which can either turn fights or lead to pickoffs.\n\n1. So If you see an early spike champ on enemy team, pick a mid game spiker, who counterpushes and picks them off, so they cannot deathball.\n2. IF you see a mid game spiker, outscale them with a lategame carry / tank\n3. and if they pick a lategame champ, counter them before they get to the end with an early deathball spike champ\n\nOnce you understand the timing aspect of drafting, THEN think about which champ counters them either in the 1v1 aspect or laning phase.\n\nThen think about what role is needed on the team (tank, initiator, carry, etc.\n\nThen you decide AP or AD. (dont worry too much about this seriously!! its a noob trap)\n\nSo heres an example.\n\nLets say your playing jungle, and they have Lee sin. Leesin peaks early, and drops off steadily. Avoid the deathball!\n\n* So we are immidiately thinking of midgame characters (check the graph above in the link) .\n* Then we think of the 1v1 aspect. which midgame jungler does well if we were to get invaded early?\n\n**This second bullet is important because sometimes you can outdraft them phase wise, but if you chose a hero that straight up gets dominated in a lane , your chances of success drop dramatically.** You want to counter phase pick them AND try to get a winning lane, or atleast a even / safe lane!\n\nSo against lee sin - we think of the champs on the **graphs that are starting low and spiking INTO the midgame, and now we FILTER to the second bullet above - Which are good if get invaded or in a 2v2? We don't want to get a good midgame champ that just gets stomped by leesin ...like karthus or shyvana for example with no chance of escape.** Udyr, is good, fiddlesticks is good, zac, wukong, hecarim are good just to name a few. These are all champs that can get away, or provide good counterplay.\n\nWe **dont** wanna do super lategame stuff like teemo, nasus, twitch, because they will take way to long to get online, and their mobility / peel is a MAJOR issue. remember we are going against an early deathball! (as per the graph linked above - You see lee sin starting high at 15-20, and steadily going down)\n\n* Next from our choices, we look at team OUR comps. and we **FILTER** again for what our team needs!\n\nmaybe an initiator (Zac and Hecarim)?\n\nA peeler for our immobile carry because our support cant do it (udyr, fiddlesticks)?\n\nBurst for their mobile but squishy team (Wukong)?\n\n* And finally you choose AP or AD, but sometimes you dont really have a good choice based on your limited hero pool, so this really dosent matter that much.\n\nArmor pen and magic pen are in the game for a reason! Dont think about this too much. a solid 5 AP comp with a perfect counter spike to the enemy team with counter ability matchups will win &gt;50%. and thats what matters! because they wont have the gold or abilities to build MR and keep you down!\n\nSO if we needed an initiator we choose zac (ap) or hecarim (AD) because we have the luxury of choice.\n\nPeeler, were only thinking about udyr and fiddle which are both AP, so thats what we got!\n\nand burst were thinking about wukong AD, so thats what we got!\n\nIf your picking early, or blind picking and not sure what to get, I highly suggest picking midgame champs (ones that spike into the midgame)\n\nThey counter any early deathballs they opponent might want ot draft, They fight toe to toe with other midgame junglers to where its mainly skill , and if the enemy coutnerpicks you with a lategame jugnler, then the game is longer, which means youll probably lose, BUT since there is more time, there is more potential for throws and mistakes, where even the perfect lategame team can lose the game with 1 bad teamfight.\n\npicking a lategame champ blindly is the worst decision - you lose to early deathball, and if anyone makes a mistake late game , you can throw any lead, even if you match against your favored midgame enemy champ. Also playing long games is a horrible way to climb, efficiency wise.\n\nAnd an earlygame deathball blind pick can be stressful as you'll have that timer feeling against almost all comps, but if you like that stress, then feel free to try it because fast games are the best way to climb efficiently. win fast or lose fast.\n\nThe average game length is 32 minutes for a reason - its midgame, so if you have to blind pick, choose a midgame champ.\n\nIn Conclusion, I would invest in learning 2 champs per timing window, and the good thing is that when Riot balances or rebalances champs, they usually dont touch their timing window, but rather smooth out powerspike curves, if that makes sense.\n\n**personally the ones Ive chosen for jungle are**\n\n**Early Game Deathball - Darius &amp; Morgana - 75 50 50 - Green pet**\n\n**Midgame Splitpush, Pickoff, or Counter-deathball - Fiddlesticks &amp; Wukong (both can build healcut early if needed, but hopefully not) - 40 60 60 - Green pet**\n\n**Lategame - Teemo &amp; Ornn- 40 60 70  - Great Scaling with items and Range CC**\n\n**(Ornn (good vs low mobility enemies) - Heartsteel &gt; Demonic &gt; thornmail(healcut option) &gt; abyssal mask) - red pet**\n\n**(Teemo (good vs high mobility enemies) - Riftmaker &gt; Demonic &gt; Morellonomicon(healcut option) &gt; Zhonyas) - red pet**\n\nI know these are SUPER niche, but I feel that is what im looking for in one-tricks. they are champions which benefit heavily from being \"one tricked\", 100% have jungle kits, and rarely get banned, so thats why I chose them specifically for myself and this post, because the statistics support them!","score":1,"comments":[{"body":"&gt; Once you understand the timing aspect of drafting, THEN think about which champ counters them either in the 1v1 aspect or laning phase.\n\nI would pretty confidently say this is untrue, timing barely matters relative to how bad the matchup is. Let's say Malphite vs Kayle, although the matchup itself doesn't particularly matter because it's just an example. While Malphite is good late game, Kayle should of course outscale him, so by your logic Kayle wins in terms of timing. However, Kayle in this matchup should be getting absolutely blasted by a Q max Comet Malphite. Like, she gets frozen on, and can't walk up to the wave because Malphite deals a shit ton of damage per Q, so she has to give up all of her CS or call her jungler to help break the freeze.\n\nIn a matchup like this, it doesn't really matter that Kayle outscales Malphite because it takes her **SO LONG** to reach this point, since she's so far behind in gold and EXP.\n\n---\n\nBut I also want to ask, why do you think that midgame champions counter early game champions and late game champions counter midgame champions?\n\nIn card games, there's the idea that:\n\n* Midrange (midgame) counters aggro (early game)\n* Control (late game) counters midrange (midgame)\n* Aggro (early game) counters control (late game) \n\nThe idea behind it is that health is a resource, winning at 1 HP is the exact same as winning at max HP. If they are much faster than you (aggro vs control), they can kill you before outscale them, but if they are only slightly faster than you, while you'll be left at low HP, it doesn't matter because you've outscaled them and won't need to lose HP.\n\nNow, this triangle does not hold up in reality since tech cards and such exist, i.e. many control decks are built to counter aggro decks, but I also don't think the triangle holds up in MOBAs.\n\nIn particular, MOBAs have snowballing mechanics whereas most card games don't. If you are ahead, it is easier to get even farther ahead. As a result, you can argue that you always want to be faster than your opponent, not slower, as you can then start a snowball.\n\nI personally don't think that's true, it's a bit more complicated than that, but I don't want to go on a rant when you haven't even explained your point yet.","score":3,"comments":[{"body":"&gt;In a matchup like this, it doesn't really matter that Kayle outscales Malphite because it takes her  \n&gt;  \n&gt;SO LONG  \n&gt;  \n&gt;to reach this point, since she's so far behind in gold and EXP.\n\nI disclosed this exact point your talking about in bold in my post\n\n**This second bullet is important because sometimes you can outdraft them phase wise, but if you chose a hero that straight up gets dominated in a lane , your chances of success drop dramatically.**\n\nThese filter steps are not optional, they are mandatory (other than the ad vs ap one lol), and if you make a mistake on one of these steps, your chances of success drop dramatically.\n\nThe ORDER here is not for priority of importance. The **ORDER here is to help categorize your thought process** to make it easier to figure out which type of champ to choose. I probably should have mentioned that in this post.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso I believe picking kayle into malphite is not advisable strategically as per this guide - Malphite is in Row 1 Column 4 - as per the graph, malphite is slowly descending into the midgame, and then into the late game. This pattern suggest that his early game is quite strong with a strong midgame aswell, and a slightly weak late game (but not a complete falling off due to his tanky nature).\n\nKayle on the other hand has a tough start, and an delayed midgame, into a good lategame. I would instead recommend a much stronger midgame champ to be picked into malphite, as he is a late deathball, early midgame champ.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs per **this triangle** I noted, while your snowball analogy would seem to apply, the **statistics actually show something completely counter intuitive, and I find this very interesting\\`**\n\nFirst Ill start with this point - If snowball mechanic were truly dominant, then early game champions would have the highest winrate of all champs, and the average game length would be MUCH shorter than 31 min.\n\nBut this not the case due to comeback mechanics of bounty, siege mechanics, Waveclear, and TWO large objectives of which typically only one can be taken and one forfeited.\n\nwithout the above listed items I would 100% agree with your statement that being faster is better, as **I had used to believe.

This was the case back in early league, early heroes of newerth, and early dota 1.**\n\nAnd I try to not fight the data.\n\nNow if you can secure the first 2 data bullets of my statement, you have a greater than 50% chance on winning the game. **(Having a later winning phase, and having a winning or even lane.)**\n\nI 100% stand by this point.","score":1,"comments":[{"body":"","score":0,"comments":[]}]}]},{"body":"Those picks are pretty far off base that might work in low elo but are terrible for climbing.

Oh and if OP decides on a jungler, I would recommend full clearing junglers as a start since their early game is relatively consistent and a lot of them scale well.","score":1,"comments":[]}]},{"body":"i have no resource i can give you that starts off with the very basics, but i'll try to break down what i think are the foundations of jungling which i learned from playing:\n---\nJunglers are governed by clear speed. What does this mean? Basically, junglers which are able to a.) kill their camps quick, and b.) kill their camps healthily, are considered junglers. Ever tried out Ashe jungle? Ahri jungle? They all feel slow to clear and you might have died to the buff at some point, too. Obviously, this means they are not good junglers. What makes a jungler good, then? Often times, it's because they have one of the following in their kit: attack speed boost, % damage health, % bonus damage modifier to monsters, or low cooldown abilities.\n\nWhy does clear speed matter, then? It's because junglers are basically on a timer, and this timer is based off of how early the scuttle crab spawns. Right now, it's 3:30. That means junglers are, at minimum, incentivized to be able to clear their entire jungle--called as \"full clear\"--before scuttle crab spawns. This means that even if Ahri can clear healthily, if she can't kill ALL the jungle camps before 3:30, then that means she is slow at clearing. On the other hand, someone like Diana can clear the entire jungle and still have around 5-10 seconds left before scuttle crab spawns--this means she is fast at clearing. Now, if a jungler isn't able to clear before scuttle crab spawns, then they run the risk of having this neutral objective (meaning they are situated right in the middle of the map--it is accessible to both you and the enemy) of having it get stolen away from you. This already sets you behind in terms of gold, EXP, and the early vision as well as movement speed buff scuttle crab gives you. On top of that, you also run the risk of losing impact on the map, because if you're still clearing jungle and scuttle crab has spawned, the enemy jungler can now choose to invade you or gank a lane. That means, at bare minimum, YOU MUST be able to clear before scuttle crab spawns.\n\nThis entire concept of full clearing before scuttle crab spawns is, essentially, the standard clear of just about every jungle. You are new to the jungle, thus I suggest you focus on this first because there are two variations this, which leads me to my next point: the standard clear starts you at either red buff or blue buff. The usual flow that you might have already seen is buff &gt; camp &gt; camp &gt; camp &gt; buff &gt; camp &gt; scuttle crab or some variation of that. The key thing is that it ALWAYS starts at the buff. But what buff do you start at? \n\nThe answer is...it depends on your champion. You do not choose randomly; you choose depending on the game. Expert junglers know which buff to start at or even which CAMP to start at. This is because the ultimate decider on how a jungler's early game will go: the first clear. This encompasses virtually how you start the game. Correctly choosing where to start has a large impact on how the next few minutes go, and as a result, the game. \n\nTo illustrate with a simple example: if you were playing Jarvan IV and you started bot side, and once you finished your full clear, you end up at top side, you were suddenly there just in time right when the laners have started brawling. They are now both low health, and the enemy jungler is nowhere to be seen. It stands to reason, then, that this lane is gankable and it is an easy first blood; you now have a lead in both the lane and jungle. \n\nThis type of thing isn't magic at all nor is it dependent on laner skill if you're playing ranked (which assumes that the players are all equal). What happens in the early game is predetermined by lane matchups. A top lane that is Fiora vs. Riven is bound to be more prone to kills and early fighting that Malphite vs. Ornn. A bot lane that is Lucian and Caitlyn vs. Kai'Sa Nautilus is bound to have more early fighting than Ezreal and Karma vs. Caitlyn and Soraka. Even in the mid lane, Azir vs. Viktor isn't as bloodthirsty as Azir vs. Yasuo or Azir vs. Katarina. Basically, in order to know which buff you start at, you need to understand your lane matchups.\n\nHowever, that is not the last piece to the puzzle. The last piece is the jungle matchup which, alongside lane matchups, dictates where you must start and your gameplan for the next few minutes. If you're playing Diana against a Lee Sin, you already know that you are weak early in a 1v1 but you clear faster than him. You look at your lane matchups: your Fiora vs. Riven, your Azir vs. Katarina, your Caitlyn vs. Ezreal, your Karma vs. Lux. You now have the necessary pieces to know where to start: you are weak early game, and you have one lane that has a lot of fighting (Fiora vs. Riven). In this case, you must avoid the lane that has a lot of fighting because Lee Sin will want to finish his full clear top side because he is a strong early ganker that wants to get lanes snowballing. He can't find that in the bot side because his bot lane can't match up against Caitlyn and Karma (they have superior push and damage). Therefore, if you are Blue team and Lee Sin is Red team, you want to start at blue team top side (blue buff) because Lee Sin will most likely start at red team bot side (blue buff). When both your full clears are finished, you will end up at opposite sides of the map (Lee Sin ends up at top where Fiora and Riven are; you end up at bot lane where Caitlyn and Karma are). This is because since Caitlyn and Karma are strong early, they will most likely have the push (which is called lane priority) in the lane, allowing you safely take the scuttle crab and do things like place vision in the enemy jungle. You do NOT want to start Blue team bot side this game because you will end up at the opposite side, and Lee Sin can either choose to invade you, fight you at crab, or countergank if you ever decide to gank top lane yourself. Simply put: you are a weak early game jungler, so you want to finish your full clear in a lane where there is lane priority--in this case, your bot lane. You want to be masked by your laners until you get your ultimate and/or items to begin impacting the game. Alternatively, Lee Sin is a strong early game jungler, so he wants to abuse his high damage and mobility early game by full clearing towards the lane that has the most volatility. This kind of matchup identification comes with learning the game, which is why it's suggested to just play one or two champions at most to make sure you can learn as much as you can.\n\nHowever, the most wonderful thing about jungling is that this isn't necessarily standard. If you know that Lee Sin is starting bot side, for example, you can do things like invade the Lee Sin's red buff and get yourself a massive lead. This protects your top lane as well since Lee Sin isn't as effective without having the EXP from the buff.","score":6,"comments":[{"body":"\nTo summarize the previous two points: 1.) junglers must be able to clear before 3:30. This is because scuttle crab spawns and those who aren't able to get it early are already at a disadvantage because it can get taken away from you since it's a neutral objective, and 2.) knowing where to start is dependent on matchups. Typically, strong early game junglers want to full clear towards lanes that are highly volatile (often times melee vs. melee matchups, or lanes that have CC to either get kills themselves or help you set up kills) beccause they have the damage, mobility, or even CC to do so. Weak early game junglers want to full clear towards lanes that are strong early, have the push, or not volatile at all. These are lanes such as Caitlyn and Karma which have constant lane push in the bot lane, or lanes like Azir vs. just about every melee mid laner. Sett in the mid lane or top lane will usually mean that he has push (lane priority) as well because very few champions can beat Sett in a 1v1 early game.\n\nWith that being said, now what do you do after full clearing? Well, you have three options: do scuttle crab, gank a lane, or counterjungle. Often times, junglers just go ahead and do scuttle crab because it's the most available option. However, if an opportunity presents itself (for example, lanes are fighting near you, or if you immediately spot the enemy jungler bot side), then forget the scuttle crab for now and either go help or counterjungle. The most important thing that junglers need to understand is that monster camps aren't going to go anywhere, but opportunities like entering the enemy jungle or ganking a lane are not present every single time. Junglers will do scuttle crab after full clearing because it's the only thing available, but if you can either invade or gank immediately or assist in a fight, DO IT. There is nothing stronger in an equal game than a number's advantage. This \"drop-the-camp and move\" mentality applies for just about everything such as doing buffs or a normal monster camp. I learned this from watching VODs of high elo junglers and they basically make sure they're immediately moving towards the lane to help since the monster camps will just be there to wait for you once you're done.\n\nBut what do you do in situations where, after you take down the scuttle crab, you can't gank or invade? Simple. No opportunities are in front of you, therefore you just place vision and start clearing again. Don't pressure yourself into doing anything if you can't seem to find stuff to do. However, I do recommend that you look back at the game and see whether or not there were opportunities present to you, especially if you are a strong early game jungler. Often times you can force a gank or an invade as a strong early game jungler as opposed to weak early game junglers, making them inherently have more opportunities to do things on the map. Champions like Diana or Kayn want to be powerfarming early on and having nothing happening is actually the best case scenario for them since they can farm in peace.\n\nwith all of that said, i'm not sure if i can add anymore. i just wrote this all in one sitting and expanded mostly on the first few minutes of jungling since that's pretty much the most daunting thing to deal with and the only thing that actually doesn't have a lot of information on available. if you have any questions, feel free to ask","score":6,"comments":[]}]},{"body":"Best way to start jungle is choose a few champions you'd like to play and the watch guides for those videos.

Most people will simply copy the most popular rune set and build without understanding how to use it, and in turn will get worse results on the champion.  \n  \nThe usage of this build is to engage and one shot squishies from longer range. This is why you sacrifice some sustained dps by building Galeforce and Rapidfire Cannon, as well as not taking PTA, as this build gives you the best longer-range burst potential.  \n  \nLucian combos in general are quite simple but this one might not seem as natural as other combos, which is why I've decided to show it on here. The combo is:  \n  \n**W - E - AA - R - Galeforce**  \n  \nAs shown in [this video](https://streamable.com/f46m9j).  \n  \nAlso in [slow-mo](https://streamable.com/7oo4ai).  \n  \nThis is the best one-shot combo that you will be using in 99% of your games where you take this build. It provides a ton of burst and the RFC auto with R follow up makes up for your innate lower attack range. The usage of galeforce is to reposition and do more damage while casting your R.  \n  \nYou will want to press W then E very quickly in order to cancel your W's cast animation.

Gaining control of the lane allows you to do whatever you want - recall for item advantage, fight with level advantage, rotate to help your jungler, etc. Winning early is sometimes **matchup** dependent (Darius will always beat Maokai level 1,) but sometimes it's **gamestate** dependent, such as a champ that has to leash and gets to lane late, or a skirmish takes place and someone gains wave control that way. Lane bullies typically have early lane advantage and get wave control easily.\n\nOne issue lane bullies have though is that they can be very susceptible to ganks, especially around that 2:45-3:30 mark where junglers that started bot are moving top. A way for a lane bully to cement their dominance in lane is to avoid ganks via the **cheater recall.** In this clip, Udyr has early lane advantage over Irelia (he beats her level 1,) allowing him to posture aggressively and zone her off the wave if she tries to CS. Irelia knows this and concedes push.\n\nInstead of blindly shoving the wave as is common in low elo games and dancing in front of her turret for no reason, Udyr decides to slowpush. He focuses on last hitting every minion for 2 enemy waves, and uses all his abilities on the 3rd enemy wave to get his wave under the tower. Now Udyr has approx. 450 gold, and can back at 3 min to avoid a potential gank after scuttle crab.

She plays decently well into most juggernauts though so that might not be your best bet up top.  So the NEXT best option is to learn when not to trade with her and play a champion like Nasus that is OK with AFK farming under tower.

Obvious dodge E if you can, but if she hits an E don’t automatically run.  It is literally called test of spirit for a reason.  If you can bully her off of the spirit you win.  You aren’t really able to do this with her ult up unless you are winning BIG, but before level 6 or with her ult on CD you can bully her a bit when she pulls spirit.  This is how you beat her with high damage champs like Tryndamere but it works for Darius and Sett too.  She wants to hit her Q across your body and your spirit so she gets damage multiplication, but positioning well prevents that.  If you have kept the tentacles to a minimum her W won’t be enough to just nuke the spirit.  Early on she probably won’t even have enough damage to “kill” the spirit anyway.  Never just run far away after she pulls spirit either unless you are certain she will kill you, that’s an auto lose…you failed the test of spirit and so now the tentacles are going to follow you and slam anyway.  Lastly don’t try to kill the tentacles while they are in the slamming on you phase, if you do that another will just spawn that’s probably in a better position and will hit as soon as spawned.

If a prison goes down or fails the first person to take the blame is the warden.","score":6,"comments":[]},{"body":"Both are important.\n\nLaners and junglers need to put themselves in the other player's shoes and consider the situation from their perspective more often.\n\nPlayers need to understand more than just raw numbers, but the significance behind the numbers. If you're 10cs/min but I'm also 10cs/min, that may be as good as/better than/worse than you being 8cs/min to force me to be 6cs/min. Kinda depends on xp denial too and how much each champ needs gold relative to the other and relative to rest of champs in game and how much gold they're getting.\n\nJunglers need to understand what counterjungling really means. Most just think it's taking an enemy camp. That's not true. Counterjungling means denying the enemy jungler resources both in the jungle and via ganks/neutrals. If you're up 5 camps, but your laner was ganked 5x, they WILL inevitably be behind from that. Which means your 5 camp lead better translate into a greater advantage than the disadvantage your laner has because you got that lead at their expense rather than through true counterjungling.\n\nLaner frustration - when warranted - stems often from that exact aspect. Junglers building personal cs/camp lead at their expense and doing nothing of value with that lead other than continuing to build a personal lead. That's not going to win you any games. Inting sion strat of past seasons among other things should teach anyone that much. Killing the enemy nexus wins you the game. You can have 1000 cs on vayne and lose to an enemy with 200 cs because they killed your nexus and you were farming lane.\n\nDoes this mean you should always gank or get neutral objectives? No. But you as jungle are in control of deciding how to invest your time much more freely than laners are. Yes, both roles are dynamic, but not in the same manner. A gromp doesn't go walking into your tower and die should you leave to help your laner with herald. A minion wave will. But you can be counterjungled. If you're ganking... it SHOULD be a counterjungle on the side of map you are on or a delayed invade on opposite side when you go back to finish a clear on the side you ganked in most cases. To both of which, there are counterplays both immediate and more long-term - especially if your gank should prove successful.\n\nBut back to the point of laner frustration. Put yourself in their shoes. If you got counterjungled 5x in the first 15 min by their laner and your counterpart (enemy jg) and your laner never once moved from lane to match their counterpart, how would you feel? Probably pretty upset. But it COULD be justified if they built a personal advantage that outweighed what you'd been set back. That would require they pressure/take tower and/or secure neutral objectives like herald/dragon via their advantage though or... helped you or another ally get ahead at other points in time during laning phase. Otherwise... they got an inconsequential lead at expense of you (their jungler).\n\nSound familiar? Right. Because that's the other shoe of the jungler that just counterjungles at expense of their laner getting ganked over and over and never gets anything on the map to counterbalance what their laner paid for getting repeatedly ganked. If you got bot/mid ahead and/or stacked dragons in exchange for top being put behind, then it may be justified - to give an example. However, it might not. And even if it is... they're still probably annoyed even if they recognize it is worth it (if you DID make it worthwhile). Remember - think back to how you felt in the scenario where they put themselves ahead at the expense of you getting 2v1 counterjungled. Even if they made it worthwhile, nobody really enjoys losing (especially when they feel they're individually better) just so someone else can look good at their expense.","score":2,"comments":[]},{"body":"&gt;Usually I play jungle but recently got into lane and what I found was that I can turn around games by just cs well and not losing lane basically.\n\nFrom a top lane perspective this heavily depends on the lane matchup and how both you and your opponent scale.

Here's what I found about Navori and their best builds.\n\nTLDR at the end.\n\n**Methodology**\n\nI tested these builds against an \"ADC\" practice dummy. I also set up a tank dummy in cases where I had to compare something that had lethality and something that didn't.\n\nI also matched gold for each build. For example, if the completed items were different in gold price by 400g, I would fill with a longsword.\n\nFor DPS %, I presented the **lowest** dps difference, as this can change if you are taking the DPS number in the middle of a burst window or between burst windows, as is typical with these caster type ADCs.\n\nHere are my conclusions - no numbers because I had them written down in the game itself but not elsewhere, so take this how you want.\n\n_____\n\n\n**Xayah**\n\nXayah is probably the single best **Navori** ADC in the game. The **only** time IE beats out Navori is if you are taking a very short trade, where you are only exchanging a single rotation of spells. In this burst trade scenario, IE wins out.\n\n**In every other situation, Navori does more damage, more DPS, and provides more utility through her W MS/AS steroid and E self peel.**\n\nI also tested PD 2nd vs. collector 2nd. Same conclusion. Collector is *very slightly* better in burst, but in terms of overall DPS, PD shines brightly, and also lets you get to your Navori quicker.\n\n**Holding all else constant, Navori nets you ~15% or more DPS than IE as long as the trade lasts longer than 5 seconds**.\n\nI recommend running: **Galeforce - PD - Navori**\n\n\n_____\n\n**Lucian**\n\nYou should *probably* go **Navori**. Unless you are with a perfect pairing like Nami or semi-perfect like Janna.\n\nAs expected, IE provides more immediate burst, and this is valuable in certain situations.\n\nFor example, if you are paired with Nami, I'd recommend going IE because you are mainly fishing for Dash + Nami E to instantly burst a key target down.\n\nHowever, if you are with any support that doesn't provide *damage* on-hit (e.g., anyone other than Nami E, Janna E), your likelihood of one-tapping someone this way dramatically drops.\n\nIn these situations, Navori provides only ~10% or more DPS beyond your initial burst of W-AA-E-AA-Q-AA-R-AA-E-AA, where IE does more damage.\n\nThis combo is probably the highest damage achievable but is only realistic if someone is running into your face.\n\nIf you don't have your ult, Navori wins out **much** further because your ultimate is what lets you bridge the period between cooldown windows if you are running IE.\n\nBeyond this, I also tested Collector 2nd vs. ER 2nd, ER is a pretty drastic drop in damage so sadly I can't recommend it.\n\nI recommend building: **Galeforce - Collector - Navori**.\n\nIf with **Nami or Janna**, build: **Galeforce - Collector - IE**. If you are coordinated, swap collector for RFC.\n\nAlso consider skipping level 2 shoes.\n\n\n_____\n\n\n**Ezreal**\n\n**The old build is better, sadly**.\n\nIn theory, crit Ezreal with Kraken, ER, Navori does a LOT more damage. In practice, this is unachievable.\n\nThe crit build requires you to be constantly autoing to reach this DPS. Because Ezreal's base stats have been nerfed so hard due to his safety, indexing into a build that requires the following is too much of a sacrifice:\n\n1) Constant autoing (giving up your range)\n\n2) No HP or added lifesteal investment\n\n3) Lower CDR without auto attacking\n\nIf you are ever in a situation where you cannot safely auto at least 50% of the time (which you will probably be if you have no added HP), you will do less damage with crit + Navori.\n\nI also tried ER variants, which I'll show in my below conclusion.\n\nI recommend building: **Triforce - Muramana - Serylda/Shojin/Hydra in whatever order is appropriate for the game state or how greedy you want to be**\n\nIf you are against an all squishy team and have absolute confidence that you will hit your skillshots, you can actually go this **ultra greedy build**, which does &gt;20% more DPS against *squishies*.\n\n**ER - Muramana - Shojin - Duskblade**. This build does absurd amount of damage but gives up Seryldas utility.\n\n\n_____\n\n\n\n**Kaisa**\n\nFinally we have Kaisa. This was a long-shot, and as expected, she's pretty bad with Navori. But read to the end, it gets interesting.\n\nNavori is equivalent to IE in terms of total DPS. This is because AD Kaisa's W is pretty low value, and her E already resets its own CD. The only value you get from Navori is that it's more fun.\n\nHowever, because one of the biggest strengths of AD Kaisa is that ability to **burst** another ADC, I advise highly against choosing Navori over IE.\n\n**If you are playing AD Kaisa**, I recommend building: **Dorans Blade - Kraken Slayer - 2 Longswords - Finish PD - IE**. This lets you rush Q evolve and get E evolve upon PD completion.\n\nHere's where it gets interesting. **On-hit AP Kaisa is actually a great contender**.\n\nThe build I am referring to is: **Dorans Blade - Kraken Slayer - Pickaxe - Guinsoos Rageblade - Nashors Tooth - Pickaxe becomes Wits End/Bork**\n\nThis build has similar burst to the AD build (-1% total damage, literally) at Q evolve and 3 items. It only lags slightly in burst at 2 items due to going rageblade over PD (no lucky crits, 20 lower AD).\n\nHowever, once you hit 3 items, you are once again at the same levels of burst, but with **15-20% more DPS**. In addition, you also get **stupid poke utility from your W**. The only down-side is that there is no good way to get mixed penetration in this game.\n\nThere is one more build that does similar burst, and **even more DPS (~6-8%)** than the on-hit AP variant, and that's running **Wits End/Bork 2nd into rageblade**. This gives you a smoother mid-game power curve allowing you to bridge to your higher DPS rageblade build. However, you give up W poke utility, so take that how you will.\n\n**EDIT: I've been proven wrong about AP Build DPS being the best, and so I have revised the above to include another build as well.**\n\n\n\n_____\n\n#**TLDR:**\n\nXayah: **Galeforce - PD - Navori**\n\nLucian: **Galeforce - Collector/RFC - IE (if Nami/Janna; RFC if coordinated) or Galeforce - Collector - Navori (all other situations)**\n\nEzreal: **Triforce - Muramana - Serylda/Shojin/Hydra depending on game state and skillshot confidence**\n\nKaisa:\n\n* If you need physical damage: **Dorans Blade - Kraken Slayer - 2 Longswords - Finish PD - IE**. This lets you rush Q evolve and get E evolve upon PD completion.\n\n* If you want similar burst/higher DPS to above, but also want poke: **Dorans Blade - Kraken Slayer - Pickaxe - Guinsoos Rageblade - Nashors Tooth - Pickaxe becomes Wits End/Bork**\n\n* If you need straight higher DPS: **Dorans Blade - Kraken Slayer - Wits End/Bork - Guinsoos Rageblade**\n\nSivir: **Kraken Slayer - Essence Reaver - Navori Quickblades**\n\nTristana: **Kraken Slayer - Phantom Dancer - Navori Quickblades**\n\nAlso, Navori is waaaaaaaaaaaaaay more fun than IE.\n\n\n____\n\n**EDIT: Sivir**\n\nI didn't even bother testing this because I thought it'd be incredibly IE-sided but I was wrong. **Navori is always better on Sivir**. She might even be better than Xayah with it. However, Sivir has many more situations to cover. Here are my findings:\n\nThree tested builds:\n\n**Kraken - PD - IE**\n\n* I thought this would be the strongest at single-target damage but I was wrong. It also falls significantly behind on ricochet targets because she gets 1-2 fewer ricochets off in a fight.\n\n* **Literally 30-50% less ricochet damage**\n\n**Kraken - PD - Navori**\n\n* Actually beats the IE variant in single-target damage by ~10% DPS\n\n* Absolutely destroys the IE variant in ricochet damage; 30%-50% higher damage depending on if boomerangs bounce back and forth between multiple targets\n\n* REMINDER: under ideal circumstances, ricochet targets can take 90% as much damage as the main target, so getting more ricochets hugely spikes teamfight damage\n\n* **MAJOR PROBLEM: Because Sivir's manacosts are astronomical (90 and 80 respectively!), she runs OOM stupidly fast with Navori.**\n\n \n**Kraken - ER - Navori**\n\n* The last point above is why **I recommend this build above all others**\n\n* This build does the same (-1% DPS) single-target damage as the PD-IE variant, but retains the insane teamfight ricochet damage of the Navori variant\n\n* This build lets you spam poke outside of teamfights and lets you spam skills in teamfights without ever going OOM\n\n_______\n\n**EDIT 2: Tristana**\n\n**Surprisingly, Navori also wins out on Tristana. It does 4% higher DPS on a short fight (10s) and 11% on long fights (20s).**\n\nDPS aside, there are some very key benefits of having Navori on Tristana, some obvious, some less so until you actually try it out in a real fight. Navori opens up huge play pattern opportunities for Tristana.\n\n* **Permanent uptime on Q**, I think it's pretty obvious why this one is good - it also has no mana cost!\n\n* **2nd and 3rd E use for a squishy target**. In the late game, it's not often that Tristana gets to assassinate another ADC. Instead, she's likely using her E on the front line. After that, she's left without most of her damage against squishier targets. With Navori, after she's done with the front line, she'll have E up again immediately to burst a squishy and chain clean-up a fight.\n\n* **Massively increased mobility**. With Navori, Tristana's W goes from 18 - 11s (dep. on level) to directly tied with Navori-E cooldown. In my testing, you can literally **rocket jump every 4.5s** on average. This is *Ezreal-level* mobility.\n\nSo basically, you gain DPS, burst/cleanup capability on key targets, AND gain Ezreal-level mobility.\n\nIt's starting to get harder to decide between Xayah, Sivir, and now Tristana as the best Navori user.\n\nI recommend: **Kraken Slayer - PD - Navori**","score":348,"comments":[{"body":"what about sivir?  \nAshe maybe but her cooldowns are quite low so might not be gold efficient","score":64,"comments":[{"body":"I doubt Ashe would be good since her Q actually has no cooldown - it's entirely dependant on hitting 4 times, and her W doesn't contribute that much to her overall DPS.\n\nSivir is definitely IE.

He has extremely strong dueling tools in his kit. Steals 10% of stats with ult, Q deals bonus isolated target damage, W is an enormous shield similar to a Sett or Tahm Kench, nearly doubling his effective health during a duel.\n\nHe's immobile. That's basically his biggest weakness. If he misses his pull or doesn't have flash, he basically just has to wait until pull is up again.\n\nPull can be oriented to push people away from you if you are running away. That's basically the extent of the fancy stuff he has to work with.

He scales far better with both ghost and flash imo, as his main weakness is lack of mobility and getting kited which are in part nullified by this summoner spell combo.

Morde is a bit unique because his innate tankiness is lower comparatively to something like illaoi, he truthfully only has W and the stat steal on R, but his R allows him to basically ignore the rest of the enemy team. He can be good everywhere as long as your R gets value. I'd describe him as not necessarily having amazing 1v1 potential, since a lot of his basic abilities are AoE and less potent vs single targets and he relies on dealing good damage over time, but his R is an amazing tool at putting him in a fight where you know you will win (I.e. he can still lose to things like vayne, fiora, but let's say you win vs kled for example, its extremely oppresively when morde can just ult you and kill you and you have no option but to fight him)\n\nIn top, he's a strong lane bully with no mana costs, innate healing and strong offensive options with E and R being very strong at trading and securing kills respectively.\n\nIn jungle, he's a scaling champ who is pretty immovable but doesn't offer a whole lot to his team. He mainly wants to pick on low independent champs like ADCs to farm a few kills with R while using his superior clear speed and strong dueling to farm and steal away camps.\n\nI'd say morde top is generally better because you can use your R in more circumstances. For example, your pushing sidelane and they come to 2v1 you, you can ult one, win the fight then from there you have at least went even, or perhaps you win the 2v1 because of that. Jungle morde just kinda has a niche because carry players are allergic to good itemisation and won't build QSS vs him, so he gets to remove the adc or mage every fight without them doing a whole lot then he will come out and either die while dealing a lot of damage or live. Furthermore because of jungle having reduced xp or gold income compared to toplane, even on a champ like morde, he will lose more fights in his R on average and you don't really get to abuse your sidelaning advantage either. \n\nMorde jungle is basically good under the pretense your enemies are not as good or knowledgeable rather than your own skill as a jungler.

Most mages pretty much can't touch him; same for many assassins, and he can stall soloQ games like few other champs can in the mid game.  Plus once he has even just Heartsteel he is basically unkillable even 2v1.  Then once he builds Titanic his AD contributions become considerable, and he is one of the best users of Teleport in the game.  In theory I think this is actually one of the best blind (pseudo-) AD champs in mid lane for people who aren't Zed one tricks.)\n2. **Talon** (**Broken roamer**, not much to say there.  However, he does have some bad matchups, and in particular, a permashoving mid laner can power to Nexus while Talon trolls around the map, and I notice in soloQ people often get really tilted to the point of inting/afking when their mid lane is essentially open, despite the resources gained in the roams.  I know this is just a tradeoff of roaming but many people can't think that clearly).\n3. **Yone** (In theory, I wouldn't think Yone is a strong mid right now in the meta given his requirement for 2 items in order to accomplish anything meaningful, but the stats right now paint a different story.  **I have a 60% win rate on this champion** (mostly as a blind pick, too) and his winrate seems to be rising globally as well.  Personally, I chalk up my WR to soloQers just inting the Yone lane constantly for some reason; people don't understand how deep this champ can dive and play way too disrespectfully in lane.  I hesitate to commit to a pick that essentially relies on the enemy inting to succeed and which offers almost zero utility pre-6, but results are thus-far favorable....)

Between using E defensively and farming with Q, he can be probably the safest melee mid laner other than maybe Fizz. \n\n2.) *nobody* expects the level 2 damage, sometimes it even caught me off guard. If you got any decent amount of poke off on them at level 1, you **can** kill them at level 2. \n\n3.)

Anyways... had some questions about League and this seemed like a good place to ask.\n\n1. **Is there a faster way to learn the 'important' abilities of most champions other than playing each one a few times? Or tricks to knowing which champs mostly do AD or AP dmg (so you can build armor or MR)?** Looking at the runes don't always help as many runes have adaptive force, I know you can look at items, but I'm wondering if there's a way to tell in the early game? I feel like half the time I make mistakes because I don't know which champions have a stun or a save, and just playing a few heroes (which is my preference) doesn't really help with this either. If anyone knows of a guide or video that goes over a lot of champions, I'd appreciate it !\n\n2. I prefer to OTP, with maybe 1-3 champions. I started playing League as ADC and really like Aphelios's playstyle and kit. However, I found myself disliking the role a lot. Felt like by the time you came online, the enemy team would surrender anyway, and it also felt like a constant pressure to find farm scraps where you could because unlike in Dota, carries don't seem to be given farm priority here (I play in low elo ofc). It did make me realise though that I prefer ranged champs over melee. **So, I was wondering if there are any flexible ranged champs that fit multiple roles (top, mid, jg, support)? Ideally, something that fits multiple roles but will not instantly tilt your fellow low elo teammates to 'FF' at minute 0 lol.** In dota, I spammed invoker, mirana and windranger usually in the mid and roaming support roles, so something like that would be cool. I was thinking Jayce for top, mid and jg at first, but he doesn't seem to offer much as jg even with the new pets. I have been playing Akshan a lot recently as well, and he seems like the best choice I found so far as he fits into the mid, top and jg roles pretty well, esp now with green pet and two tank runes, he can be pretty beefy and versatile in his build (being dps focused, tanky or anti-tank items, whatever you need). Any others to consider?\n\n3. **Which objectives are most important in the early-mid game?** I always see my team focusing on dragon (which usually feels like a 50/50 on whether or not we take it or get wiped and give it away lol), and very little focus on herald. But to me, herald seems way more useful as you can literally take 2 towers with one herald and open up a bunch of the map...?\n\n4. **Speaking of the map, how important is vision and map control in League?** In Dota, playing around vision was probably the most important thing. But in League you have access to a lot more vision and anti-vision (red scan thing), so it is much easier to obtain and remove here. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like you don't really need to play around established vision but can usually create and remove vision around objectives when you think a fight might start? As for map control, I feel like people seem to put a lot less emphasis on defending towers in League, I'm wondering if there's a reason? In my games, certainly people get way crazier about defending dragon than an entire lane of towers sometimes...\n\nThanks for any help!","score":18,"comments":[{"body":"1. is tricky you could watch youtube videos on the most popular champs to learn what their kit does but id recommend playing aram as you’ll see a wider variety of champs than in norms/ranked (aram is everyone gets a random champ with 1-2 rerolls.\n\n2. 100% a chunk of the adcs can be flexed into another roll: trist/lucian mid/ad, vayne top/ad, kindred jg/ad, ezreal mid (kinda)/ad, senna supp/ad to name a couple. aphelios is tricky because when you’re flexing an adc to another lane it’s because they can do something that lane can already do. for example tristana and lucian are really good mid because they can be played similar to an assassin with their quick close range all in and vayne can be flexed too because of how her kit works better the more room she has to move around (as well as her dmg and scaling since top is played like an island). unfortunately you’re right for the most part about league players playing for their adc until you start playing in around plat elo (from my experincr btw but it’s hit or miss) no one cares about you as everyone else is more impactful unless you’re extremely fed coming out of lane phase. \n\n3. 100% rift is the most important early game obj, the amount of gold and impact that can be gained with a rift herald far out ways first dragon. rift can secure you first tower gold + plate gold + gold for rift herald and it opens the map and makes it harder for the enemy as now they have more places to ward and have to be careful as they don’t have a tower to hide by if they’re in the middle of lane. as the game goes on drag becomes more important as you fight for soul/elder but baron can be very important depending on state of the game and what you can gain from baron and it’s buff.\n\n4. map control is elo dependent. in low elo nobody pays attention to their map and they die to stupid things (most low elo players don’t even know how pings work if you want to warn them). the higher you go the more important the map becomes with high elo players stating the game is played from the map first.","score":11,"comments":[]},{"body":"1: There are 163 champions in the game. I don't think there's any shortcut to knowing who has a stun or not. I'd suggest lots of ARAM and Normal Draft practice and just familiarizing yourself. As far as damage types, I think Mobalytics works really well, and is underrated. You can just search a champion by name and it'll show you their preferred build and you should be able to hover over the items and see if they're AP or AD items.\n\n2: In low elo, people will constantly leave massive waves alone to go sprint to the nearest pointless fight in the jungle. I don't really see competing for farm being that common of an issue because low elo players in general don't prioritize waves often. Akshan can absolutely be played Top or Mid, but he's hard and will take some time investment to get worth out of him.\n\n3: Early game the most important thing is your CS and Rift Herald. I agree, people focus on early drakes way too heavily and it's not that game making. Most games are decided more on who dies at the drake fight, rather than the actual buff the drake provides LOL\n\n4: Vision is incredibly important, and criminally under-emphasized in low to mid elo.  In high elo though, and pro play, you'll see the entire map spammed with vision and it's absolutely game winning. Every time you back and buy your item components, always get a control ward. They're very useful and only 75 gold. Keep in mind though you can only place one Control at a time, as placing a second will destroy the first. Vision is VERY crucial, and what you're seeing is that low elo players don't know that, but don't go thinking it's the case overall.\n\nAs far as defending towers, it can be situational. If I'm playing Shen, I might sacrifice my tower or some tower health to make an amazing play across the map, or I'll sacrifice my T1 turret if we're doing a big push with Rift on the opposite side of the map.","score":3,"comments":[]},{"body":"1. Just playing against some of the champs will probably be enough to get a hang of it.

Yasuo/Yone can fit anywhere except support and maybe jungle. Ekko is pretty flexible. Swain can fill a few roles. Karthus can go nearly anywhere. \n\n3. Depends on your win condition. If you scale worse than the opponents, you might want to focus on herald, which pays out much quicker. \n\n4. Overall, deaths are less punishing than they are in DOTA. You don’t lose any gold and the enemy gets a bounty. Don’t worry too much about vision at the detriment of CS.","score":2,"comments":[]},{"body":"You get those infos faster from googling.

You can absolutely roam as an enchanter depending on your champion, prime examples are nami, morgana, and lulu.

As long as he's a good enough shot and is good at running away, he can eventually knock the nest out of the tree.\n\nIMO a really good ranged support should never ever lose lane. But sometimes your team needs a tank or someone to engage/start fights. For instance I'm an Amumu support main. Generally lane is really hard, but occasionally I can get good engage with my 2x stuns. It relies very heavily on my ADC being able to pump the damage though. I do very little of my own. At level 6, I become an absolute terror for all kinds of scenarios. I contribute a ridiculous amount to a dragon fight for instance. But especially early on I'm liable to die most of the time if I go in. Sometimes once I get Evenshroud+Zhonya I can survive a fight. Also if my team is just really fed then it's easy to survive.\n\nBut meanwhile you take something like a Xerath or a Lux and I genuinely don't know how it's possible to lose lane on that champ (to a melee support).

How much Resistances Increase EHP\n2. How much Penetration Increases Damage\n\nIf we're talking in terms of maximizing damage, say because you can't 100-0 somebody yet with a single combo, then the idea that Magic Pen is more effective against targets with lower MR is more relevant.

The math on it is really weird to conceptualize.\n\nSome people don't believe that magic penetration is good against low MR targets; rather, it \"scales with enemy HP.\" This is because magic penetration is effectively reducing their eHP.\n\nThe argument is if you have a target with 1000 HP and 100 MR, eHP of 2000:\n\n* Each point of magic penetration reduces their eHP by the same amount, 10 eHP, no matter how much MR they have. 99 MR has an eHP of 1990, 98 MR has an eHP of 1980, etc.\n* As a result, in their minds, magic penetration is equally effective against all MR values.\n* However, if you double their HP, the amount reduced by magic penetration is doubled. If you have 2000 HP and 99 MR, suddenly you have 3980 HP, a **20** HP loss.\n\nSo this is why some people believe that \"magic penetration scales with HP and only HP.\" However, **THEY ARE WRONG**.\n\nIt's not that magic penetration scales with HP, **every** source of damage scales with HP, provided you kill them.\n\nThat's the one fact that this argument overlooks: *you have to kill the target*. \n\nBecause you know what also scales with HP? **Raw AD.**\n\nLet's say a Kog'maw takes 10 autoattacks to kill, and a Maokai takes 40 autoattacks to kill.\n\nIf you buy a BF Sword (40 AD), you increase your damage by 400. However, against the Maokai, you increase your damage by **1600**.\n\nThe tankier a target is, the more times you are able to hit them, so as a result, **every source of damage scales with tankiness**, provided you kill them.\n\n---\n\nThe problem with this logic about magic penetration is that \"magic penetration scales with HP\" doesn't matter if everything (BF Sword, Needlessly Large Rod, Luden's passive, etc.) scales with HP. However, it's the OPPOSITE that matters. \"Magic penetration doesn't scale with MR\" means a lot when everything else scales with MR.\n\nIf everything scales with magic resistance except magic penetration, that means that magic penetration is weaker at dealing with MR than every other source of damage.\n\n#That is what I mean by everything is relative.","score":1,"comments":[]},{"body":"I suggest people to have a spreadsheet where you can do the calculations yourself. I'm not sure if the topic is a contradiction, it may be the incorrect math terms being used (I don't know them myself, so I'm guilty of that) and overall semantic terms. What is exactly something being \"more effective\"? Removing more effective health?\n\nSo, again, instead of falling into semantics, I think it's better to just create a spreadsheet and run tests. \n\nA target with 30 armor and 1000 health has 1300 EHP. \n\n* Attacker A deals 100 damage per hit. Those 100 damage get reduced to 76.92 due to armor reduction. He needs 1000/76.92 = 13 attacks to kill. This matches the 100 base damage against 1300 EHP.

Because Sion died during a good lane state, he can TP back and chooses to hold a freeze. Camille is now forced to try to crash her wave under tower otherwise Sion can freeze. If Sion freezes, Camille will miss out on a ton of xp and gold because Sion's minions are all dying to her wave instead of surviving long enough for her to return to lane and collect. So she stays to fix the wave. She dies in the process, but at least her wave is \"fixed\" because Sion now makes his wave push while trying to kill her.\n\nIf Sion were low elo, he could have just Q'd the minions and began his own push (slow or fast,) and Camille would have been fine to recall. She would not have been forced to choose between death or missing a ton of xp and gold.\n\nSo even though you don't normally think that a Sion can freeze vs Camille because of **matchup**, he can because of **gamestate**.

Sometimes squishies don't really think about ranges of enemy spells. I'm constantly aware of whether or not the enemy Ori is in range to Q -&gt; R my ADC for example. Sometimes my ADC is not though so they walk up, get stunned, and die.\n\n2. They forget that I have cooldowns. If I just cc'd an enemy off of you, or used a protection cooldown, I can't do that for another 5-10 seconds. The enemy usually knows this and will try to kill you while my CC is down. You need to back off entirely once it's down and not re-join the fight until it's back up.\n\n3. They fight without me. I need to stay in my lane as well, otherwise the enemy will have a 300 CS Aatrox at 25 minutes. If you can't win a fight without your tank, don't start one without your tank. It's often the tank's job to decide when and where fights happen, and if the Vayne decides to be the initiator instead for some reason, it's going to go badly.\n\n4.

There are like \\~4 tanks in this game. Everyone else is just \"tanky\", **which means that only 4-5 champions are capable of aggro/taunt/charm  mechanics** in short they can force the enemy in to attacking them. This is the main thing that defines \"tank\" as a class. Without these skills, a champion is only \"tanky\" which means that he is capable of sucking a lot of damage. But he can not force other players in to attacking him. So what it means is that enemy champion in every fight chooses who to to attack on his free will. If you have only tanky champion, it doesnt mean that the enemy will attack him.  Doesnt matter how much defence your tanky player has, or how much he engages the enemy, if he has no charm, taunt or other similar ability, he has no options to force the enemy team in to attacking him. They can simply ignore him and attack those who posses danger to them. \n2. In this game it is far more important to save up health during the fights. Which means that sucking up all the damage in the botlane and going base to reheal or risking losing your life is really not great of a deal. So the best option is to evade an attack or simply do not engage in the enemy attack range. **You only attack when there is a high chance of not getting damaged at all or getting damaged for less than you inflicted to the enemy.  Thats all.** Every exchange must be valued by this principle. \n\nYou simply can not heal enough health during the lane phace, there are hardly any champions capable of healing themselves without losing their potential to maintain the lane. Meaning that even if you heal yourself every time you get damaged, you lose mana and that is even more crucial, because when you have no mana, you lose all the option to defend/attack/counterattack or in some cases even escape. You basically become the freekill. \n\n You got to understand these things if you want to maintain the lane properly. As well as use these things against your enemies, for example tricking them in to using their abilities often without getting you damaged - they lose mana and if you have more mana then them its a huge advantage, you can push them and win something if it is not a kill, then you most likely will win summoner spells, they will have to heal themselves or flash away... etc.. \n\n**The game is happening not when you use the skills, but before that, the use of skills are the final step in your engage, the finishing touch.

This consists of getting a small minion lead on your enemy aka you have more allied minions in lane than they do. Once you get a minion lead, you can keep the balance as is (say they have 4 minions you have six you can stop hard killing minions and leave your wave to about +2 minions). Then you just last hit and maintain the balance. As your next waves come in, your waves will compound over and over and auto push until they crash into the enemy. This is the basic idea of a slow push. Slow pushes are better than fast pushes in top lane because you have a long lane to set them up. They allow your more time to base or ward or roam or whatever. They also help to COUNTER the danger of being ganked, which becomes more likely as you push. If you have a big ass minion wave your chances of winning a 2v1 are much higher. A slow push will also usually help you REBOUND the wave which I will explain further down. \n\nFreeze when you want to: deny cs, set up a gank\n\nTo freeze a wave, you want to have less minions (about 3 to 4) in your wave than the enemy wave. It is best to leave more of their caster (ranged) minions alive because melee minions have weird pathing and will suicide to your tower. Your goal is to stop the wave a little before your tower so it does not attack minions. Since the wave is closer to you your minions \nWill arrive first. Maintaining about a 4 minion deficit helps prevent the wave pushing out and breaking the freeze. It is harder to freeze when you are losing lane and the enemy can just all in you. It’s best to freeze when you are winning. You can use the freeze to zone the enemy. \n\nNow the rebound. The best way to set up a freeze is to slow push. If you do it right the incoming enemy wave will show up while your big ass wave is still under tower. This means your wave will get caught further up even though the numbers get evened out. This is good because then the next enemy wave will arrive sooner and start pushing to you. You let the natural push occur just last hitting and thinning the wave so it doesn’t push too hard. Then when the wave is in a good spot you can freeze. If you don’t slow push, but instead fast push, your wave will likely die to the tower and then the next waves will reset the wave in the middle. It’s easier to freeze off a rebound. \n\nCSing is weird sometimes. Try and pay attention to projectiles from your wave. Also learn to mask your intentions when farming. Aka don’t walk in a straight line at the cs you want to last hit. Dance around a little in the general area and then go for it.","score":12,"comments":[]},{"body":"What rank/elo are you playing?

On Monday night, 5 hours before the ranked season ended, I hit diamond for the first time after a little over two years of playing LoL. Most of my climb through platinum I played Orianna, ending ranked [top 50 in NA](https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/rankings/summoners/orianna/na) on her and [top 40k in NA overall](https://www.op.gg/summoners/na/emerhom).\n\nIn this post I will go over several things from my own history, my thoughts on climbing, and some specific suggestions for those wishing to play to win. Feel free to skip any sections you wish, but hopefully you will find some parts that pique your interest.\n\n&gt;*\"It's just a game... For some people.\" -Silvxs*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**--My Path to Diamond--**\n\nI started playing in season 10. At the time I just wanted something to do during free time. After playing for a few months, I joined an intramural team at my college. At the time I was silver and all of my teammates were gold-plat. I loved playing organized League, but, being surrounded by players better than me, I knew I needed to improve. I obsessively tried to hit gold, but, partly due to an unhealthy mindset towards the game, I was unable to do so before the season ended.\n\nIn April of season 11, I was finally able to hit gold, mostly through grinding games. I had been playing mostly mages, and I was convinced that that was my issue. I switched to an assassin (Qiyana) and actually shot up to platinum by July. At that time I was confident that I'd be able to hit diamond in season 12, and so I got lazy. I had gotten to plat on Qiyana by punishing basic mistakes made by my opponent, and I didn't focus on trying to improve beyond that.\n\nAs season 12 started, I struggled to climb. I barely clawed my way back to plat with Qiyana and then I was stuck. Eventually, I remembered back in silver when I had enjoyed playing Orianna. I went back to her and fell in love with the champion again. This champion is perfect in my eyes. When played well, she is a lane bully who scales well with insane damage, amazing utility, and the strongest teamfighting ultimate in the game. With a heavy farming style, I slowly climbed from P4 to P1. Then I got stuck again. On the doorstep to diamond I faltered and tilted my way back down to the bottom of P3. I took about a month-long break from ranked. When I came back, I duo'd with a friend for a while. I made it back to plat 1, but I knew that if I hit diamond while duoing, it would not feel like I had proven to myself that I had earned it. So once we made it back to plat 1, I went the rest of the way myself. Two days before the season ended, I was at P1 80 LP. I played 14 games in those two days, going 9-5, to finally hit diamond.\n\nAll this to say, sometimes the path isn't as straight as you'd like it to be, [sometimes it's windy](https://imgur.com/a/2XfHZ5u). Stay focused on the game and I promise that the climbing will happen.\n\n&gt;*\"Chaos is a ladder. Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. The fall breaks them. And some are given the chance to climb, but they refuse... Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is.\" -Petyr Baelish*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**--Attitude Towards the Game--**\n\n&gt;*\"It is a man's own mind, not his enemy or foe, that lures him to evil ways.\" -Buddha*\n\nIt is perfectly fine for LoL to just be a minor hobby. You play some normal games with friends every once in a while and call it a day. If that's the case, if you'd like to put your passion into something else, that's totally fine, and I would recommend you skip this section. If however, you would like to put your efforts into LoL, then your attitude towards the game is critical.\n\nIt has been talked to death in the League community: you need to have a good mindset. Many people will tell you that the mindset you should have is to improve. While this is a good mindset, in my experience, it can be frustratingly difficult to tell if you are actually improving. I think there is a better mindset, one that is more natural for competitive games, which I will explain here.\n\nCompetitive games are wonderful things. In a competitive game, there is no right and no wrong, no beautiful and no ugly, there is only winning and losing. For this reason, I think the best mindset to have is to play to win. To play to win requires you to be focused while you are playing. It requires you to look at each match with only one goal: to see the victory screen. But it also requires you to look back when you lose and analyze why you failed to win. To figure out why you failed and improve so that you can win in future matches. And when you are truly playing to win at the peak of your ability against an opponent who is doing the same, well there's nothing else like it.\n\nTwo quick disclaimers. Firstly, LoL is a team game and the occasional game will be out of your hands, your goal is simply to maximize the chance that you win any given game. Secondly, there will be times where you will be focusing on improving one specific aspect of your play. At these times you will not be at your full strength since much of your mental resources are going to this one aspect. This is within the scope of \"playing to win.\"  It is a form of training so that you are able to win other, more important, matches in the future.\n\n&gt;*“Winning is not the point. Wanting to win is the point. Never letting up is the point. Never being satisfied with what you’ve done is the point. The game is never over.” -Pat Summitt*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**--How to Play to Win in LoL--**\n\nMy first suggestion is that you should have two accounts. One account is your true ranked account. You only queue up on this account if you feel you are able to perform at your best. Whenever you are queuing on this account, you play each match to win. Your second account is for when you want to focus on improvement or when you want to play to win but know you are not at your best. Maybe you really want to focus on checking the minimap every few seconds, or maybe it's late at night after a long day. Those are the times for the second account. Why not just play normals or flex queue? Because people in those queues are usually not trying to win. To improve yourself, you must be playing against opponents who are also playing to win.\n\n&gt;*\"There is no teacher but the enemy.\" -Orson Scott Card*\n\nMy next recommendation is that you review your games. You don't need to review every game, but you should review some of them (say 1/3 to 1/5). I am convinced that many people asking for help improving are not reviewing their own games. I think everyone should be able to identify some flaws in their own gameplay by watching. If you truly cannot see what is going wrong, find a friend or someone online who is higher ranked (plenty of people will do this for free), get on a discord call, and go over a game.\n\nFinally, learn what kind of a player you are. Do you like to skirmish as much as possible and outplay with your mechanics? Are you a dominant lane bully? Personally, my biggest my strength is on [midgame farming](https://imgur.com/a/WeuDREV). I'm no Chovy, but compared to other plat and diamond players, I simply find more gold on the map from 15-30 minutes. Once you know what kind of player you are, when you are trying to win a match, you can play around it, and when you are using a match to improve, you should look to improve another area that you are weaker in. For example, just by looking at the graphs linked above, I can see that I need to work on my laning as Orianna as I am dropping too much CS.\n\n&gt;*\"If you find yourself in a fair fight, you should reexamine your tactics.\" -John Steinbeck*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*\"The only way to defeat a superior enemy is to stop at nothing. To become what they fear.\" -Silco*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**--Resources for Learning--**\n\nThe most important part of learning is simply playing to win and looking at why some strategies work (cause you to win) and others do not (cause you to lose). However, especially with a game as complex as LoL, you can save yourself a lot of time by learning some theory from others. Remember though, you must put what you learn into practice, and that is the difficult part of becoming a champion.\n\n&gt;*“If I have seen further than others, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.” -Sir Isaac Newton*\n\n* [Play to Win](https://www.sirlin.net/ptw) \\-- A free ebook about how to play to win. I would strongly recommend reading this. Several sections of this post are based on this book. If you don't have time for the whole book, here are a few recommended subsections:\n   * [Introducing... the Scrub](https://www.sirlin.net/ptw-book/introducingthe-scrub) \\-- About how to not have the mentality of a scrub.\n   * [Introduction to the Art of War](https://www.sirlin.net/ptw-book/introduction-to-the-art-of-war) \\-- The main portion of the book is a rewriting of the art of war for competitive games. This intro goes over Sun Tzu's five essentials for victory.\n* Phroxzon's Mid Lane Guide, [Old](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iko2tqmDpJQ&amp;list=PL9RdXhXESRJzgY_SwHB8T-cZxXljWhQvz), [New](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf27qzFKv60&amp;list=PL9RdXhXESRJxf-FxBijbuBOnEJHDrmB2O) \\-- The single best LoL educational content ever created. Short 5-10 minute videos that each cover a single topic. Even if you're not a midlaner, there's a lot to be learned here, and if you're a midlaner who has never watched these, you definitely should.\n* [Shok](https://www.youtube.com/c/ShokLoL1) \\-- A midlaner ex-pro from OCE who now makes educational content. Has longer guides on many topics and champions. Does a fair amount of VOD analysis of pros. Also streams on [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/shoklol) and will answer questions in chat.\n* [Dobby](https://www.youtube.com/c/LoLDobby) and [TOTSS](https://www.youtube.com/@TodayOnTheSuperServer) \\-- Mostly analysis of Korean soloqueue and pros. Dobby is better for learning basics, TOTSS tends to go much more in depth.\n* [PekinWoof](https://www.youtube.com/@PekinWoof) \\-- Ex-academy midlaner full length commentated challenger games. Honestly, not the most edu focused, but I've been watching this guy for so long and he definitely deserves a shout out.\n* [Coach Curtis](https://www.youtube.com/@CoachCurtis) and [BBC](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbkFsQcaQ_CuPWTBrsEm6cw) \\-- Mostly talks about how to the meta of how to play the game (e.g. mentality to have, how much to play, champion pools). Is a generally wholesome member of the community, my suggestion would be to listen to his videos as you would to a podcast. I think his stuff helped me improve my mental towards LoL quite a lot.\n* [Dodge game](https://loldodgegame.com/skillshot/) \\-- Play \"skill &amp; dodge\" on \"hard\" and only use Q ability. Will help with mechanics.\n* Finally, if anyone would like help from me, feel free to reach out. Obviously I'm most experienced on Orianna, but I should be able to help anyone low plat and below playing control mages.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**--Conclusion--**\n\nThis post ended up being rather long. If you read through any portion of it, thank you and I hope it was an interesting read. For my part, I'm going to spend this season trying to improve as a player overall and maybe add 1-2 champions to my pool instead of being an mostly an OTP.

If a top/mid got fed while others lane are having an equal game, they are already winning the match. First thing you gotta accept is you are playing an almost lost game. So the best answer is to keep your focus on farming, finding openings, avoiding combat and ganks, in the hope they don’t use that spike to close the game.\n\nUsually, stronger teams in early can fall when you close the farm gap, so you gotta stroll the game, and try to farm efficiently","score":1,"comments":[{"body":"Also capitalize in their mistakes, whenever they try to pull high ground","score":1,"comments":[]}]},{"body":"ADCs are the best state they've ever been in, which just shows how terrible the role is overall.
