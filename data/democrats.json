But don‚Äôt click away just yet, because Benton‚Äôs career trajectory is what makes this story amazing.\n\n*A Republican political strategist was convicted of illegally helping a Russian businessman contribute to Donald Trump‚Äôs presidential campaign in 2016. Jesse Benton, 44, was pardoned by Trump in 2020 for a different campaign finance crime, months before he was indicted again on six counts related to facilitating an illegal foreign campaign donation. He was found guilty Thursday on all six counts.*\n\nAs a separate Washington Post report noted last year, Benton‚Äôs career trajectory is a sight to behold. It began in earnest 14 years ago, when the GOP operative worked on then-Rep. Ron Paul‚Äôs 2008 presidential campaign. Two years later, Benton took the next logical step and ran Rand Paul‚Äôs Senate campaign in Kentucky.\n\nTwo years after that, Benton went back to the other Paul, running the Texas congressman‚Äôs 2012 presidential campaign before agreeing to return to Kentucky in order run Sen. Mitch McConnell‚Äôs re-election campaign, all while preparing to run the younger Paul‚Äôs 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nIn 2013, however, a problem arose: Benton was caught up in a scandal involving an attempt to buy an endorsement. He was later indicted as part of the fiasco, but that didn‚Äôt stop a pro-Trump super PAC from hiring Benton anyway in March 2016.\n\nTwo months after getting the new gig, Benton was convicted, but he continued to do political work in 2016, including engaging in efforts to assist a Russian national who want to support Trump.\n\nIn September 2016, Benton was convicted as part of the previous bribery scheme, but he avoided a prison sentence and was ordered to serve two years of probation. He later picked up a pardon from Trump, who had an unfortunate habit of handing out pardons to Republicans accused of corruption.\n\nBut Benton was then indicted again, not for the 2013 campaign-finance violation, but instead for the 2016 campaign-finance violation: He was charged with helping funnel money to Team Trump from a Russian national. The operative was convicted yesterday.\n\nIn other words, Benton was pardoned by Trump for one crime, only to get busted again soon after for a similar crime.\n\nBenton is currently awaiting sentencing.

He's constantly testing new lines and new themes at his rallies. If he gets a big response, it becomes integrated into the stump speech. If not, he drops it. So by the end of the campaign, rallygoers leave excited and energized, and ready to donate money and enlist their friends in their crusade to save America.\n\nThat said, I think that he, like the great communicator Joe McCarthy before him, is starting to wear out his welcome.

He uses demagogy to stoke racism. He lies about matters great and small. As president, he frequently placed his personal interests above the national interest. He promised to lift up ordinary Americans and instead delivered tax cuts for the wealthy that significantly increased the federal debt. He was a friend to dictators and an inconstant ally to liberal democracies. He made the country‚Äôs military position in the world demonstrably weaker by foolishly withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal, which even a senior Israeli official now concedes was a serious self-inflicted wound. And in perhaps his greatest test as president, he treated the Covid-19 pandemic as a public relations problem, downplaying the danger and resisting basic safety measures that would have saved lives.\n\nIf he is elected, a second Trump term would lack whatever guardrails were in place during the first. Over the course of those four years, Mr. Trump grew bolder in his defiance of the other branches of government, disregard for the law and flagrant abuses of presidential power. This time, he would be running with the support of those who are not only aware of his worst abuses but have also embraced him as the wronged party. He is likely to be surrounded even more completely by sycophants. Consider, for example, whom Mr. Trump might choose as an attorney general. At the end of his term, Mr. Trump forced out his own attorney general, Bill Barr ‚Äî a loyal supporter but someone who was unwilling to openly break the law ‚Äî and tried to install a midlevel Justice Department official whose primary qualification was an apparent willingness to do exactly that on Mr. Trump‚Äôs behalf. A second term promises to be a revenge tour of grievances and political payback.\n\nThe Democratic Party has an obligation to do more than simply point to those possibilities. Democrats must take seriously the challenge of offering to Americans an appealing alternative. The ultimate justification for democracy and upholding the rule of law is that it is the system of government that provides the best life for the most people. Democrats argue, correctly, that voting against Mr. Trump and his allies is the principled course. They must also show voters that democracy is worth defending, and that it will improve their lives and the lives of their children. In countries where weak, ineffective opposition parties leave people without hope or good alternatives, it is easier for autocrats to fill the void.\n\nMr. Trump gravely damaged American democracy, but there are promising signs that the wounds are beginning to heal. Nearly without exception, the losing candidates in the recent midterm elections have conceded with grace ‚Äî even some of those who had attacked the integrity of the election system during their campaigns. The return of Mr. Trump‚Äôs dark circus threatens that progress. He will once again tempt Americans with misinformation and outright lies, veiled threats and outright calls for violence, insults and provocations. By rejecting his bid for a political revival, Americans can put Mr. Trump in the past, and get back to the hard but necessary work of self-government.‚Äù","score":37,"comments":[]},{"body":"The NY Post ran the headline Florida Man Makes Announcement! üòÇ","score":24,"comments":[{"body":"","score":0,"comments":[]}]},{"body":"I offer the following slogan for the coming campaign season: 45 =/= 47.\n\n45 MUST NOT = 47","score":12,"comments":[{"body":"","score":0,"comments":[]}]},{"body":"Doesn‚Äôt matter what we do or don‚Äôt deserve.

That is the problem with lies. \n\nThe GOP has mostly given up on policy. \n\nThe rank and file Republicans have been conditioned to not care about details. They just need to know who to hate.\n\nToday a study was released that since the vaccine, Republicans are dying at 2X the rate of Democrats from SARS-CoV-2. Again, lies catching up with unfortunate consequences. \n\nThose who know they have been lying are now wondering whether they should rethink, but how do you tell people you have been lying when you have used emotional manipulation to make the alternative reality part of your supporters ontology? \n\nDemocrats have their issues, but their adherence to school scientifically demonstrated facts and fact-based party initiatives will ultimately pay off. We are seeing some of this already.\n\nWe should not deviate from this. Supporting Trump lunatics in the primaries worked, but it madee feel icky. This is not who we are.\n\nStay true.\n\nThey are feeling consequences of their years of lies. The only way Democrats fail is by being drawn into this.","score":1,"comments":[]}]},{"title":"Trump‚Äôs Running, and Republicans Have Only Themselves to Blame","not_safe_for_work":false,"locked":false,"body":"","score":52,"comments":[{"body":"Hopefully Trump losses the nomination but people collect enough signatures to get him on the ballots anyways.","score":3,"comments":[]},{"body":"Hi there!\n\nIt looks as though the article you linked might be behind a paywall.

Schwartz, an associate professor of Health Policy at the School of Public Health at Yale and one of the authors of the study, told Motherboard. ‚ÄúOur study can't answer that. But it certainly seems plausible given just how stark the differences in vaccination rates have been, among Democrats and Republicans.‚Äù)  \n\nThe professor should have mentioned that in a medical testing environment, the experimenters would be ethically and morally obligated to halt the experiment, in order to deliver more than placebos to the control group.  \n\n  &amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;^(Schwartz said that he and his colleagues wanted to look at something that hadn‚Äôt been carefully studied before. ‚ÄúCould we actually drill down at the level of individuals‚Äîin this case of individual death rates‚Äîand see whether or not politicization could be linked to mortality,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo far, it looks like there really is a signal here, particularly linked to the availability of vaccines.‚Äù)  \n\nMost who *chose* to reject vaccines did so based on disinformation offered by various cults, most often those cults some  mixture of antiscience, politics and religion.  The cults' disinformation was then amplified and broadcast by the Republican leaders to capitalize on cult support for personal gain.  \n\n  &amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;^(First, our mortality data, while detailed and recent, only includes approximately 80 percent of deaths in the US. However, excess death patterns in our data are similar to those in other reliable sources,‚Äù the study said. ‚ÄúSecond, because we did not have information on an individual‚Äôs vaccination status, analyses of the association between vaccination rates and excess deaths relied on county-level vaccination rates. Third, our study is based on data from the only states where we could obtain voter registration information - Florida and Ohio; hence, our results may not generalize to other states.‚Äù)  \n\nCredit to Schultz for trying to remain apolitical, while trying to describe how politics may have contributed to excess deaths.

Republicans have expanded their drunken swerve into the oncoming traffic lanes of science and medicine, and as many as they're able to maim and murder, truth will out, in summing up the dead.\n\nRepublicans should be held legally accountable, not just in terms of \"do we still have the numbers to win elections,\" a morally repugnant place from which they are sure to start.","score":1,"comments":[]}]},{"title":"New Jersey Democrats moving toward putting abortion on the 2023 ballot","not_safe_for_work":false,"locked":false,"body":"","score":29,"comments":[]},{"title":"Democrats sue to allow Saturday voting in Georgia runoff amid holiday dispute","not_safe_for_work":false,"locked":false,"body":"","score":122,"comments":[{"body":"Standard GOP voter suppression tactics.

The septuagenarian, who sported a deep gray suit and pale blue tie, spoke matter of factly.\n\nProsecutors allege that the Trump Organization participated in an illicit compensation scheme that illegally lined Weisselberg‚Äôs pockets to the tune of $1.7 million of untaxed income.
