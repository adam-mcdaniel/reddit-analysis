From the hot jock, to Captain America, to Lloyd Hansen - it's been a pleasure seeing your career grow and transform. But beyond this, and what makes you stand out from the crowd, you've been the most real and genuine person I've watched in Hollywood. Your humility, your love for your family, friends, and Dodger, your sense of responsibility to use your voice for good. And so much more. I truly admire how you've never deviated from your narrative over your 20+ years in the industry. So when you speak, we listen. We believe in it. We believe in you.\n\nThis is why your Fandom loves you and why we are so loyal. Up until now.\n\nThis passed week, it's like we won the lottery when you finally got the title of Sexiest Man Alive. Finally! As long as I waited for it, I actually felt glad that you only received it now because I believe you are at your best right now. And finally you are being recognized. I was so saddened when this pride lasted all two days.\n\nI have to start by clearing this up: your Fandom is not upset because you're in a relationship. Rather, it was the reveal of your relationship that made us feel betrayed by you. We feel betrayed by the Chris you lead us to believe is you.\n\nAs a human being, I fully believe that you deserve your privacy and you will obviously only share what you feel comfortable. During TGM press tour, you were asked a question that had nothing to do with your romantic life. You, however, chose to answer with regards to your romantic life. You volunteered this information. Yes, you didn't explicitly say you were single. But you sure did imply it. During your People interview, you once again im plied you were single. The publication even reported that you were. Realistically speaking, this should have no bearing on our lives as fans. However, as your loyal Fandom, when you speak, we listen. We believe in it. We believe in you. This sense of betrayal is not because you are in a relationship. It is the rude awakening that our belief in you is based on nothing but lies that you've seen selling us. If you could volunteer up lies about something so trivial, what about you is actual real? It's like a kid finding out Santa isn't real. This may come across as completely dramatic to most, but I hope you realize how influential you have been in our lives.\n\nYour relationship is really not our business. I personally know nothing of Alba, and will never know the dynamics of your relationship. A side note: An average 41 year man looking to settle down, start a family and live a quiet life at home will probably not do so with a 25 year old woman at the start of her career. It is just an indication how you've unfortunately contradicted yourself. I could go on, but I'm going to leave it here.\n\nMy only hope is that this message will somehow reach you, and that you will understand the impact you have on the lives of your fans, and how you have hurt so many of us. Although I'm sure you will choose to only see the part that support you.\n\n---\n\n^^I'm&amp;#32;a&amp;#32;human&amp;#32;volunteer&amp;#32;content&amp;#32;transcriber&amp;#32;and&amp;#32;you&amp;#32;could&amp;#32;be&amp;#32;too!&amp;#32;[If&amp;#32;you'd&amp;#32;like&amp;#32;more&amp;#32;information&amp;#32;on&amp;#32;what&amp;#32;we&amp;#32;do&amp;#32;and&amp;#32;why&amp;#32;we&amp;#32;do&amp;#32;it,&amp;#32;click&amp;#32;here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/wiki/index)","score":14,"comments":[]},{"body":"The second hand cringe is painful.","score":4,"comments":[]},{"body":"they literally put all that into words and they're not embarrassed ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è","score":4,"comments":[]},{"body":"","score":0,"comments":[]}]},{"title":"This man","not_safe_for_work":false,"locked":false,"body":"","score":41,"comments":[{"body":"Ram ranch.","score":2,"comments":[]},{"body":"normally I don‚Äôt like posting someone‚Äôs face for having a cringe profile but holy shit those hashtags","score":0,"comments":[{"body":"Ikr, he looks more like a gainer to me.","score":2,"comments":[]}]}]},{"title":"I‚Äôm sure this‚Äôll cure his sons embarrassment","not_safe_for_work":false,"locked":false,"body":"","score":39,"comments":[{"body":"That's why you don't idolise people.","score":6,"comments":[{"body":"Especially ego driven, adrenaline fuelled racers - they do things that seem logical in the heat of the moment.","score":3,"comments":[]}]},{"body":"Max has been a dickhead his entire career.
