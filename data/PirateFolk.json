Yes.... its true: SHANKS WILL BE AN ANTAGONIST, AND A GOOD ONE AT IT. Shanks and Blackbeard are clear parallels to each one and to their respective captains/mentors - Roger and Whitebeard, but the big difference is that while the first two marked an era with good values, they really didnt accomplishe anything. it wasn't their time, they \"were too early\" as Roger said. But now... now its the \"PIRATE'S ERA\" as its been told since chapter one. And the Pirate Era will be marked by true pirates - scheming, shady, treacherous and ambitious - BlackBeard and Shanks, the two characters more close to a classic idea of what a pirate is. They will be a dark version of their mentors and the final wall Luffy will have to topple to be Pirate King. I'm gona divide my theory in points so it can be clearer.\n\n1. Black Beard and Shanks were allies since the begining and possibily cousins/brothers. Don't you think its odd that of all characters, we don't know Shanks name!? He will probably be Marshall D. Shanks or Something D. Shanks.\n2. Both of them had ties with the WG because they were part of royal family who was secretly a D. and thats why they were expelled and tortured and wanted to take revenge, be pirates.\n3. The point 2 gives some clues on how Shanks had the power to meet the Gorosei. But how if he is an enemy seeking for revenge? That's right he knows the secret of Marijoas! And is working as a double agent without them knowing.\n4. Teach scared Shanks because Shanks tried to convince him to kill Tatch in order to get the Yami Yami no Mi, part of their plan. Yes, Shanks is the mastermind who corrupted Teach. Teach at the end of the day was a lost boy who couldn't sleep, his main goal was always to dream someday, a peaceful dream...\n5. Shanks is using Luffy to unlock the One Piece because he always knew he was Joyboy, since the fruit choose him to be Nika. Does Shanks emphatize with Luffy? Certainly! Isnt he a true pirate who puts his goals above any ties? Yes! and that will be the true lesson Luffy will learn. What's the meaning of a true pirate, a lesson that Shanks left it unswared since chapter one \"comeback and give me the straw hat when you're a real pirate\" our hero will have a new answer to his mentor of what a real pirate really is!\n6. Shanks will kill Garp in front of Luffy and both of them will clash.\n7. Mihawk will be disgusted by the reveal of Shanks true intentions and will oppose him, but this time it's for real and Shanks, a cunning pirate, will not give his rival a final confrontation. Blackbeard will appear and kill Mihawk.\n8. Zoro + Luffy, who were always equals and parallels, will fight Black Beard + Shanks and will be victorious all of this in LaughTale. EDITED: **bb will defeat zoro and shanks will cut luffy's right arm so they're equal. like if luffy payed a debt. in gear 5, luffy will use zoro as is true RIGHT HAND, and zoro being luffys arm and hand will use a sword to finish both of them, like a combined attack. like luffy and zoro were only \"ONE PIECE\".**\n9. After the victory, we readers, will be digusted with Shanks but the secret of One Piece will reveal that him and Blackbeard were part of a prophecy and that they all did this for Zoro and Luffy to have their final lessoan and unlock the true power of One Piece in order to defeat Im and msot of wall, in order to change the world's geography as it was.\n10. Shanks was always led to believe he was an honorable pirate, there will be a twitst that he is a final villain, but at the end he will be a tragic hero, just like Itachi.\n11. Im will still be the final villain, and I don't have that much clue on how the final fight will be.\n12.

There's a tl;dr just before the next pic.\n\nIt turns out that Vegapunk ate the Nomi Nomi no Mi (brain fruit). It lets him store infinite knowledge at the cost of a supersized physical handicap. Let's give this some thought:\n\n* This devil fruit allows Vegapunk to remember an infinite amount of information at the cost of enlarging his brain in a very uncomfortable, inconvenient and even dangerous way. A head the size Vegapunk had in the flaashback would make his neck snap at every move. That usually means death or *only* tetraplegia if *you're lucky*. Maybe such an injury could have been used so that his design referenced not only Albert Einstein but Stephen Hawking too.\n* I don't remember any other devil fruit having a benefits/cost ratio this low. Maybe the Doku Doku no Mi (Magellan's poison fruit) that has the user self-poisoned permanently would be a distant second place. Caribou has infinite storage inside his quicksands without the need for his body to become huge. The same applies to Bramenco's pockets and Blackbeard's darkness. Why would the brain devil fruit require for the brain to physically grow to satisfy the increase in storage capacity?\n* An average adult brain can store up to 2.5 million gigabytes (that's a bit more than 2500 x 1TB hard drives). If you're not familiarized with these units, let me tell you that is an unfathomable amount of memory. No human being ever has run out of memory space (unless there's malfunctioning involved) because having a limit makes our brain be selective about what information it stores and what it discards. That's why there are so many useless things we don't remember no matter how recent they are. And let me tell you too that the amount of memory space needed to store some information is not related to its usefulness in the slightest. For example, a single image in this post takes thousands of times the amount all the text in the post requires. A compendium of all scientific knowledge humans have ever discovered wouldn't occupy more than a 4k HD movie.\n* Having a brain the size of Vegapunk would mean that he remembers perfectly every single detail of every life event he has ever experienced. So, most of Vegapunk's brain's contents are useless. He's suffering a severe physical condition in exchange for remembering useless things such as what he had for dinner two weeks before his 28th birthday or what shape, color, origin and placement had all the stains he has ever had in his shirts.\n* What's worse, memory capacity is not the main nor the best feature of a bigger brain. It's computational power. What makes us humans really much more intelligent than other animals with a smaller brain isn't memory storage, but the more efficient way to use it. Specifically especializing brain regions in different tasks such as logic, language, etc. In the case of humans, memory capacity is in fact of very little importance because we have a variety of artificial ways of storing data. In the world of One Piece is widely spread the use of books.\n\n**tl;dr (because I realize this got out of hand): Memory capacity is the least important perk of having a big brain, if all that devil fruit does is turning you into a walking library and gives you a supersized head in exchange that's very likely to snap your neck at any time, this might be the most useless and hazardous devil fruit ever.**\n\n[Ch. 1067 p3](https://preview.redd.it/ju6l82521p1a1.png?width=1040&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04329620952f20e8486173cd3094f5c2e7d74a2c)\n\nThe sooner I speak... Faster access to data is the only perk to his devil fruit because it's all in his brain. He doesn't need to look for a book that has the info, he remembers. But since the handicap was too much, Vegapunk sacrificed his faster access in favour of mobility and lower instant death risk. Totally understandable. Why do I say he sacrificed his faster access? Because now his body isn't physically connected to his brain and he relies on an antenna. This is like the difference between having your laptop physically connected to the router or it using the wi-fi. Now his access speed to info has a bottleneck due to the antenna. All in all, in his current state, Vegapunk is a man who ate a devil fruit and he takes no benefit from it. He can't swim, his brain is disconnected from his body and far from it which raises lots of risks like what if someone bombs the island? Vegapunk can escape only for him to die anyway as his brain is destroyed. Or if someone just cuts off the signal either by damaging the antenna or blocking the brainwaves at Punk Records.\n\n[Ch. 1067 p4](https://preview.redd.it/euxm91v51p1a1.png?width=1032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dae3856125702b08c2055dd3d620af89bf093f69)\n\nNote in the second panel that Vegapunk has been now been drawn in a handful of panels only, and his head's size is already inconsistent. I'm not joking. I refer only to the apple-top Vegapunk. The portion above his eyes changes in size from panel to panel.\n\nOkay... Am I the only one who has the feeling that this information is redundant and we already knew most of it despite it technically isn't? All the exposition we've been having about the satellite Vegapunks was (inconsitently) showing this pretty much, so now that this is explicitly said, it feels repetitive. And the two bits that would be truly new have their issues too.\n\nMy \"clones\". With quotation marks obviously, because they're not clones. So, Vegapunk should be saying what the satellites are (simply robots or cyborgs, in which case, are they purely artificial or modified natural beings... whatever) but he doesn't. So that part is just useless dialogue.\n\nThen he says the satellites connect to his brain once a day. Really? Why? I'm going to try and come up with an explanation for this to be consistent with what was previously shown about them, but first and foremost: If the second or third time a character is talking about one specific topic and not in a mysterious manner but trying to explain things, that topic isn't clear yet but rather it raises questions, then someone is doing an awful job at explaining things.\n\nOkay, we've seen how the satellites share feelings and can speak among them in real time. That means they're in permanent connection. It's pressumable that each one of them has a \"brain\" of their own for obvious reasons. A memory storage they won't exhaust in a lifetime, just like we don't either as I said previously, so they use Punk Records as a back up with the excepcion of possibly the True Vegapunk who might lack any brain other than Punk Records.\n\nThat would mean that he doesn't have the same connection the other satellites have among them. But why? If he can easilly be permanently connected to Punk Records why would the others, who clearly have built-in technology to permanently be connected to one another, not be permanently connected to Punk Records and the true Vegapunk by extension?? It makes no sense.\n\nBy the way, I'm leaving out of the pics some of the filler panels that add nothing of value and that just like last chapter they're more than a few.\n\n[Ch. 1067 p5](https://preview.redd.it/ac4yyr5a1p1a1.png?width=1033&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c101db121f052b1e05127d34334f0cd2d1e5d6b9)\n\nAnd just like that Vegapunk reveals himself to be the archetype of the hivemind villain. The villain that wants all people to merge in a single conscience. Vegapunk just said he wants to take over the world by connecting the mind of everyone to his.\n\nI like this because I didn't see it coming and I like it because it's not presented as an evil plan or something like that. I really detest the shallow evil villains that are bad for the sake of being bad. No one really does things because they're evil. Everyone thinks what they do and especially what they want to do is good and right. They might be wrong or even crazy, but ultimately they believe in what they want.\n\nThis is similar to a real fact that involves Albert Einstein. When Nazi Germany was doing research to creat an atomic bomb (they didn't exist yet), Albert Einstein wrote to the president of the United States and told him to start researching them too so that when Germany suceeded, they wouldn't be the only ones. Einstein was a pacifist and detested the idea of atomic bombs. However, his words were the ones that lead to the Manhattan prooject by which the United States succedded in creating atomic bombs. Germany on the other hand failed. Later, Einstein said that if he had known Germany would fail, he wouldn't have said anything to the US and atomic bombs wouldn't exist. He had the best of intentions, but they also lead to awful things.\n\nJust like Vegapunk thinks it would be great for everyone to become part of his mind, yet if you think twice about it, it's not difficult to see how terrible it would be.\n\n[Ch. 1067 p5 &amp; 6](https://preview.redd.it/yv76jg8d1p1a1.png?width=1106&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea29587dc97637add0f3af117c5c7e049394a92d)\n\nJinbe raises some concern about Vegapunk's plan and Vegapunk happily takes a machiavellian approach and justifies everything in pursuit of a goal.\n\nBonney reproaches him, but not for his selfishness, the evilness or the flaws of his plan. She does it only out of a personal grudge.\n\nNotice how for the whole scene, Luffy disappears. He isn't even drawn in the distance or anything. I really think Luffy, who values freedom above everything else (not to mention he's now \"the warrior of liberation\" to be even more explicit), should have said something about Vegapunk's plan. And obviously something in the line of \"*you're evil incarnate and my number one enemy if you want all mankind to share a single mind.*\"\n\nBecause it's not just a regular hivemind what Vegapunk wants. He wants everyone to be connected to **his mind**. Not just any mind, not a common mind, no. **His mind**. So, if we take away all the sugar-coating in his words, what he wants is to colonize the mind of every person so that everyone is Vegapunk. Better worded, **so that Vegapunk is everyone** and only Vegapunk exists as a rational living being. Put this way, the evilness shows a bit more, right?\n\nSo, I find it disgustingly convenient that Luffy is nowhere near to speak his mind about it. I wonder if he's going to ignore this for the rest of the arc, given after this, Vegapunk isn't even depicted as a villain in the slightest but rather as a damsel in distress.\n\n[Ch. 1067 p6 &amp; 7](https://preview.redd.it/vruupwih1p1a1.png?width=1093&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8c5e393069cf4f7d1d8d57a00c20c4c8fd1c779)\n\nBonney threatens Vegapunk with the jedi saber and guess what? Lots and lots of insects immediately come flying towards the light. Great. It's not shown, but I imagine the insects are killed by the jedi saber, right? I mean what else could be those lightnings roasting the insects, right?\n\nOkay, some questions:\n\n1. Why would the jedi saber toast the insects? In chapter 1064 (3 chapters ago) that jedi saber cut. It cut through metal even. And now the insects are merely burnt not cut.\n2. Given that now the jedi saber only burns without even deforming what it hits, why would that be any threat to Vegapunk who was introduced by using teleportation?\n3. We see the insects come from across the sea. This is just surreal. Where all those insects swimming in the sea waiting for a jedi saber to activate?\n4. How do they notice that?\n5. Do all insects come at once? So, after the initial batch there are no more left that will come? Wouldn't then be no problem in using the jedi saber again?\n6. Why didn't they come earlier when Bonney used it to cut?\n7. And most important, how much time are Bonney and Vegapunk waiting in that same position for the insects to come from so far away?\n\n[Ch. 1067 p7](https://preview.redd.it/3f722zgk1p1a1.png?width=1045&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f66debacf730f971362895b0912b634742639705)\n\nLook who's here now! Luffy wasn't there when his freedom and the rest of the world's was being discussed, but he's back to pick up a beetle. Way to dumb down the manga.\n\nBonney fainted upon the insect onsalught. If she fainted... how did she toast all the insects? I think we were just victims to a stupid way of conveniently getting rid of Bonney for the time being.\n\nNow look how well linked is everything in this scene. Vegapunk reflects on the irony of one of his failures saving him. Are we really to believe Bonney was seriously threatening him instead of that being just an overdramatic scene for the sake of flashy comedy?\n\nBonney wants Vegapunk to fix his father, why would she kill him before he can do that? But the most intelligent person in the world really thinks he was in danger. So... \"*speaking of which*\", right? No. Not right. You weren't speaking of that at all. You just started a stupid reflection in order to conveniently bring up this other topic. So, the question is, why would you want to talk about Momo's devil fruit now?\n\nThat is considering how awkward it is that he knows about ~~Momo~~ someone who ate his devil fruit, about him being from Wano, about him being in Wano... I mean, in the Government's side only the CP0 had that info. They're trying to kill Vegapunk, why would they have shared this or any other recent info with him?\n\nEven more, why would he leave a synthetic devil fruit of that caliber abandoned in Punk Hazard?\n\n[Ch. 1067 p8](https://preview.redd.it/wc725yqn1p1a1.png?width=1033&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b92e180f1fb62c641376c8e37a04bbbe183bc5e3)\n\nNow we know why you wanted to bring up that topic! To make this silly charade and try to show yourself as a humble guy while in truth you brought up the topic out of nowhere just to show off.\n\nSo far:\n\n1. World domination plan: **‚úì**\n2. Mass destruction weapons: **‚úì**\n3. Little or no moral concerns: **‚úì**\n4. Megalomaniac personality: **‚úì** **‚úì** **‚úì** **‚úì** **‚úì** **‚úì** **‚úì**\n\nYet he's not treated like the villain he is.\n\nAnd regarding the \"joke\". Did you laugh at this? Because I didn't. I wouldn't have laughed at this even over an internet text message.\n\nBy the way, anyone else thinks it's not the brightest idea to butt your head against the ground antenna-first when that's literally the one thing that separates life from death for you?\n\n[Ch. 1067 p9](https://preview.redd.it/3v5ugfqq1p1a1.png?width=1045&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cddc6215665322cd03a386a9d414efc32fd16dc)\n\n\"*Make it move!!*\" Luffy was rooting for the robot to move too last chapter and he's vehemently showing his interest in it. That's good. That's what I would expect from Luffy. Basically because that has had much focus after the time skip everytime Franky showed something robotic. It makes me wonder what was happening through Luffy's mind back in Wano when Robin told her: \"*Hey, there's the Pluton down there. Do you want to like... take a look or something?*\" And he said: \"*Nah, not interested. In fact I haven't even really seen this country because I was captured the very same day I entered it and I only left prison to fight Kaido and now that I just woke up after the fight, I only want to leave. Nothing on this country has my attention. Not even a giant ancient warship of futuristic technology that has been very important during our journey as a pirate crew.*\"\n\nOn the other hand, reading something about 900 years ago and 200 years ago, I really like that. I think it's good to have more variety than put all the eggs in the same 800-years-ago basket as usually.\n\n[Ch. 1067 p9 &amp; 10](https://preview.redd.it/5vqnkheu1p1a1.png?width=1105&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b437bcc5ccf9dd091dda265bf70833ade9e56bc)\n\nSo, a giant robot makes it to Marie Geoise and then runs out of power. The World Government wants it destroyed but scientists think it'd be interesting to study it. Up to this point everything seems reasonable.\n\nBut it turns out the scientists took the giant robot and brought it to Egghead and hid it there to study it. Well...\n\n1. I don't want to tell anyone how to do things, but in my humble opinion, that robot is not particularly well hidden. I mean, it's in an open area next to the shore of the island. Insects just got there from outside the island, they only had to fly in that direction. The very security measures of the island threw the protagonists right there after causing a very big explosion at the site and didn't care at all afterwards. I don't know... that's not my definition of hiding something.\n2. That's not my definition of studying something either. Usually you want to take a bit more careful approach with the things you study.\n3. The robot was right there in Marie Geoise, city of the tenry≈´bit≈ç, who order its destruction but somehow before an admiral or some other military force can do so, \"scientists\" snatch it away. I find that hard to believe. Like, very hard. Marie Geoise is anything but unguarded and not really known for harbouring scientists, so... How come?\n4. This one I know it might be too much of a nitpick, but I'll write it for completeness I guess: How did they move the giant robot out of Marie Geoise and to wherever? Especially provided the orders where to destroy it, it seems rather obvious that the thing would need to be disassembled before it could be transported.\n5. Anyway, a group of rebellious scientists, betraying the World Government, took the giant robot from the void century that attacked Marie Geoise to Egghead and \"hid it\". How come no one has ever gone there to retrieve it and ensure it was destroyed?\n\n[Ch. 1067 p10](https://preview.redd.it/6ovrswix1p1a1.png?width=1042&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd978c071be5abf951fbd43aa3feb2a6572edb9a)\n\nCan you believe that?? Aware that the giant robot is anything but hidden, we get additional useless panels to try and convince us it was well hidden. \"*Good job finding this place... it has a hidden entrance*\" Sorry evil old man, but you only need to come from the beach to get there.\n\n\"*Oh no, we didn't find it, it was a coincidence, we were lost*.\" Are we meant to believe that? Really? How come you didn't turn yourselves in at the nearest Marine Base accidentally since you were old and senile? Oh right, because not only is an ultra stupid excuse per se, it's also false. Jimbe was actually a bit younger, same as Bonney. So no getting lost. You're trying to divert the fact that you got there because a policeman pacifista opened a whole to that place from inside a facility.\n\nI don't know how relevant will that bit of info regarding fishmen be, but it's fake news. You can check chapter 620. 200 years ago, fishmen and mermen separate from other fish, form their own country, enter the World Government, establish friendly relations with the Government and even attend reveries. There was nothing like fishmen right movements then. They weren't discriminated against like they have been in the recent past. The same chapter explains the problems for fishmen mostly arrived with the Age of Piracy. That's 20 years ago not 200.\n\n[Ch. 1067 p11](https://preview.redd.it/c98aub102p1a1.png?width=1044&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ce75b93f8f973907f088c9c9934c33d42c2a72f)\n\nLet me get this straight, the main feature of that robot was its incredible power source, so amazing that 200 years of study later, no one including Vegapunk could recreate it. Yet what happened to the giant robot in Marie Geoise is that it run out of power. Nice.\n\nOn another matter, oh how I await for the time someone takes the mask off that character that's been impersonating Luffy for so many chapters now.\n\nFirst he doesn't care at all when Vegapunk speaks about his world domination plans. But now, now he sticks his nose in something he doesn't know at all. That is, what happened to Kuma. None of us know. Original Luffy would be cautious and not judge something or someone based on the first thing he listens about it. The first example that comes to mind is Johnny &amp; Yosaku saying Nami killed Usopp and how they saw it with their very own eyes. Luffy decided not to outright believe it and waited to have more info on the matter. Not anymore. Bonney says Vegapunk is bad because he did things to her father, so Luffy just hates Vegapunk for it. Not for his world conquering intentions though. That, he doesn't care at all.\n\nIt's surreal.\n\n[Ch. 1067 p12](https://preview.redd.it/uarn0yd32p1a1.png?width=1048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94eebd770cfbda73a4c3b747d0c30e3f29973b8f)\n\nPromises, nice! I can't wait for them to never be addressed again.\n\nVegapunk asks Luffy to take him away. If this was chapter 452 I'd expect the reason for such request to be something completely different than the immediate threat that represent the CP0 as they would more likely be a red herring. But we're in chatper 1067 and I'm afraid Vegapunk's reason is the obvious one. He doesn't want to die. This comes with some questions again:\n\n1. He can't take Punk Records with him so... Is his brain inside a cage so durable that he's confident people like Rob Lucci or Akainu couldn't damage it? Because otherwise... He's dead regardless of how far his body escapes.\n2. Why was Shaka a couple of chapters ago telling Dragon he'd die? He already knew about the Mugiwara pirates being there. If he thought an escape plan was possible, he wouldn't take his death for granted, so... does he believe on the escape plan or not?\n3. He was introduced last chapter by teleporting. I know I've said this already but... can't he just teleport away by himself?\n\nDo you see Luffy's face in that panel? That's the face of not knowing how to act because you once had a personality but now you're nothing more than a clown and it's got difficult to know when are you supposed to be serious and when aren't.\n\nLuffy doesn't know if he has to say:\n\n1. You have an apple instead of a brain, welcome to my pirate crew!!\n2. You want to steal the freedom of every single human through your hivemind project, don't expect help from me.\n3. You made Bonney cry, drop dead somewhere already you old creep.\n\n[Ch. 1067 p13](https://preview.redd.it/ydxz6sn72p1a1.png?width=1041&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebaa7bcce2d081066513e4c007c5b363b69c0a1e)\n\n\"*Reports indicate Jewelry Bonney is here too*\". Reports from who?\n\n\"*She's served her purpose*\". More promises. short-term hype increases, long-term potential disappointment also increases. We'll see.\n\nCan someone remind me why are they returning a problematic seraphim to egghead if they plan to assassinate the one man that can fix it?\n\nAnd what's the point in putting a mask on if everybody knows who you are? At least for the previous CP0 agents we didn't know who they were. I mean, we immediately knew whenever we saw them because they weren't precisely hiding but at least their identities were unknown. We know all three CP0 agents this time around. Why? Because Oda has to put masks on them because Robin said not so long ago that masked agents are stronger than unmasked ones. If they didn't put a mask on, there would be no hype at all, and Oda can't afford that. But narratively and plotwise, it makes no sense.\n\n[Ch. 1067 p13](https://preview.redd.it/la5aclra2p1a1.png?width=1038&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e77906b0d33664ac3ae7e7db5e00c702c352a72c)\n\nThis chapter, despite being only 15 pages long, still has so many filler panels. But, wouldn't you just prefer a blank panel or one or two less pages instead of this?\n\nI mean, that's disgraceful. At this point Luffy should kick out of the crew everyone except Jinbe, Zoro, Brook and maybe, just maybe, Nico Robin. I remember the way Jinbe or Brook stood in front of Big Mom and then I see this... What were you doing for the last two years? Were you preparing to conquer de Grand Line or what?\n\n[Ch. 1067 p14](https://preview.redd.it/n93zmh4d2p1a1.png?width=993&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9109a1815e227df698f3d65a604b42708327dc17)\n\nA character addressing the situation at hand, making sense, honouring the attribute that was said to define him, not being overly dramatic, not attemtping an anti-climatic joke, getting shit done. It's my favourite panel of the chapter and it's actually the only one I'd spare. Because this should be the minimum standard.\n\n[Ch. 1067 p14 &amp; 15](https://preview.redd.it/4jd9gwqf2p1a1.png?width=1098&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79010ebb7b505298254fbb3db0208b800aa72f96)\n\nMystery! Why is Kuma running away? This one looks like it should have a short-term follow up so I'm inclined to think this will be addressed, but again, we never know nowadays, so we'll see.\n\nBy the way, this is the first time we see Kuma run. Do you know why? Because Kuma doesn't run. He teleports or pseudo-teleports with his devil fruit power. But plot required Kuma to be overly dramatic and yet not to actually leave the place so... Kuma doesn't do that anymore. It's time to use those strong legs he's got.\n\n[Ch. 1067 p15](https://preview.redd.it/9kg9cqji2p1a1.png?width=1051&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d414ae823aef60bee76044b8f31d7564c8703817)\n\nNo one knows why he's running. Everyone tells him to stop but no one does anything besides that. They're aware he's a pacifista. They should expect him not to answer and not to obey them.\n\nThere's a man there that stopped Smoker with his presence alone. Noy just stopped him but made him obey (and we're talking about Smoker here). But he can't stop a damaged Kuma unable to make three consecutive steps without tumbling. All for the sake of ending in a dramatic cliffhanger.\n\nAnd I want to end this review by noticing that a couple of chapters back I praised the illustration. I said it got way better. Well, I think the illustration is also good in this chapter too but there's a very big difference with respect to that other chapter. This one barely has any backgrounds. There are lots of panels that feel really empty. That's not good.","score":15,"comments":[{"body":"Least piratefolk analyst.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJokes aside, good analaysis of that, it could turn out to be true, just hope Oda doesn't have a GODA moment.","score":4,"comments":[{"body":"Yes, my style is really different than the usual around here.

But the problem is using the same joke each time, it become less funny. It is a bigger problem when the joke has been seen in many shows before. So oda thinks that exagerating things, it will be funny. The Nosebleed gag for example. A joke since master roshi, very funny but we have seen it so many times that it will be difficult to laugh at it. It is a trope now in anime. So what oda did, he made sanji nosebleed so much that he almost dies. That is the joke. Please remember that at one point in the story, sanji (one of the best fighter in the SH pirates) almost died because he could not handled seeing women/mermaid. \n\nSanji was a character presented to love women, well he has the right. Any man will be attracted to beautiful women. Let me remind you because even oda seems to have forgotten himself. The joke was that sanji is presented as this clever person, a mastermind, a competent chef, one of the mature person of the SH with nami and robin but who also is a strong fighter as well, but when he is in front of women, he is a complete idiot. He is so trouble by women that he can easily be fooled, i.e sanji vs kalifa.  Where Zoro and Luffy are just raw strength, Sanji compensates his lack of strength with his smartness. Enies loby is a perfect example of Sanji's genius. So at this point the character of sanji was unique. He also does not go against his word, he said he will not hit a woman no matter what, and he stands on this. Even if it means death. This shows a weakness in sanji and a fatal flaw. Well as for me , a good character is a character that has flaws. Sanji afterall cannot change who he is and the values given to him by Zeff. This shows that he really value Zeff. Zeff told him to never hit a woman no matter the reason, and he sticks to this firmly. To overcome this flaw, Sanji relies on his nakama. Sanji said it himself, \"do what i can't do and i will do what you can't do\" to Ussop during enies loby. This greatly helped boost Ussop's self esteem, who was starting to feel useless as he saw that his nakama are more powerful or competent than him, he felt useless when compared to them, he had insecurity issues. But Sanji helped him get over this and shows to Ussop that he really has a place in the SH. This demonstrate Sanji high EQ. But then oda decided to make sanji a complete pervert after Enies Loby. This is there that oda completely butchered Sanji. He went from a complex character to just the perverted friend trope. \n\nI think oda underestimates his readers, he thinks that the more complex the character, the more difficult it will be for us readers to read.

King has higher ap, is faster and more durable and has higher battle iq. and even with that Zoro low diffed King after he got acoc and after that was only koed because of the mink med, Sanji was koed because he was actually exhausted","score":1,"comments":[{"body":"","score":0,"comments":[]}]}]},{"body":"Ifrit jambe‚Äôing Queen as far as hybrid kaido did pre-G5 Luffy is only not a good feat because you choose not to focus on it.
