He does try, at one point in the story he even swaps out his ace, certainly thinking his strats aren't good because of it. But in the end, he comes to terms with his true calling. His goal to become the Champion gradually decays and his recklessness is due to not having realised his true calling earlier.\n\nNemona wants someone who can push her to her limits because she already accomplished her goal and it resulted in no one any capable of stimulating her anymore. Even Geeta caught that Nemona wasn't completely serious during her examination. She needs someone to prevent her hard work from stopping, because it just can't stop. You can't just accomplish your goal and not make sense out of it. And this is where YOU come in.

In this case the bull doesn't die as it is made in places when it can come back to land, but still suffers great stress.\n\nThen the Fighting-Fire type, inspired by the \"Bou embolat/Toro embolao\", translated to \"bull in fire\", in this practice, torches are attached to the bull horns and people have to provoke and evade its charges. In this practice, the bull isn't killed, but again, is put through a lot of stress and risk of suffering burns.\n\nAs a Spanish, I just wanted to give some context of the inspiration of this forms.

If it was up to me I would have made it Diancie. Sure it's a legendary, but she's champion, and it can even mega-evolve.\n\nAlola is a bit weird with its trainer classification, but 2 examples come to mind is having Nanu and Molayne's ace be regional forms (Persian and Dugtrio respectively), but then i learned that there are no other mundane Steel and Dark type introduced in Alola (Honestly I would've given Nanu Incineroar, it's a dark type cat, why wouldn't he have it?)\n\nGalar: Ignoring Leon's charizard, which everyone and there mother complained about, Bea, Alister, and Melony's main pokemon being Machamp, Gengar, and Lapras make no sense for me.

I would love to make myself look my age. Hell I think anyone older than 12. I understand the game is mostly aimed towards children, but we all know the game has a older fanbase as well, as when the first game was created, i was the young boy.\n2. The game has a lot of bugs. I'm not even finished and I had a crash, I went through multiple walls and I had pokemon dissapearing on me when they used a certain move in battle. Do note, when it crashes you have the option to send information about it so the creators can learn what happened. Do this please, it will help the game. It is nice that this option is there as it clearly shows they want to work on the flaws.\n3. Most of the edges of areas are rough. Understandable as this is pokemon's real open world game. But should be patched out and not after years.\n4. I also had issues with the tera raids, as the game shows you like 10 raids that are open but you can't refresh until a few minutes. And when you try to join them, most lock you out of them because it is full before you can join because loading takes long.\n5. The leveling path is strange. It is open world yes, but eventually I did the bug gym as 5th even though it is originally meant to be the 1st lol. I also did the very last gym as 6th wich made real gyms 6 and 7 a breeze. I also did Mela first, wich is supposed to be done later in the order but as she was closest, I just leveled hard in the area around it, and I eventually destroyed her with my evolved form of fidough, wich can take fire attacks, take no damage and can turn it into defence. Without it I never wouldve known how to beat Mela. It didnt have a logical pathing for the most part.\nIt would have been fine if level scaling was around based on the amount of gyms you have beaten. Not based on the pokemon level of your pokemon.\n\nThese are the biggest points I could find, but other than that it's a amazing game. I love the terrastralize mechanic as I really like gems and such, and its so pretty. It's also less intimidating for others in raids as opposed to what raids in sword and shield looked like/also with the empasized music. I myself was not touched by this, but I can imagine some people might've found it a bit nervous making for who are sensitive to that.\n\nThe art style is pretty but personally I loved the eyes of the sword and shield characters more. Now it looks less 'pokemon' in a way. Not per se bad.\n\nGameplay wise, yes I agree. 100% best game in the franchise. But with updates the cosmetics, bugs, etc could make it even better.

It and the hub city are this HUGE extravagant set piece but they're both so empty. None of the buildings have interiors and the school doesn't even have hallways! And coming at this from a software development perspective, it's clear that they're cutting corners to meet deadlines, but why like this? Because the first thing that I'd advocate for is like... making the school smaller so that you don't have to spend as much time filling it with stuff, and so the performance issues aren't so obvious? But that's not what they did, because Game Freak, at some level, doesn't fully control what goes into their games. I'm willing to bet so many design decisions are made at the Pokemon Company level so that the new generation can be aligned across all lines of business. So they say, \"Paldea has this giant Pokemon Hogwarts\", and the people who make the TCG and the show and the merchandise are like \"cool, we'll center that in our content\". But then if Game Freak is like, \"well that is a completely unreasonable scope for the timeline you've given us to make this video game\", TPC just says \"tough nuts\", because failure to release the game means at least like 3 other companies now have no sellable product. They've set this cadence where everything has to release at once, INTERNATIONALLY in like ten different languages, so if one thing gets delayed everything has to be delayed, and from the perspective of the money people that cannot happen.\n\nIt's the same thing with the sandwich minigame. It's so detailed, they modeled so many, like, conventional groceries, and for what? Why didn't they use that time to make the game perform adequately? Probably because the anime episodes centered around Ash making sandwiches with Koraidon are already in post-production and TPC has decided that this is something they can't drop the ball on. So Game Freak is forced to make this tradeoff of, well if the performance is bad it might sell *worse*, but if there's no sandwich minigame then the TCG cards full of sandwich art are going to make NO SENSE.\n\nWhat these games really need is for all parties involved to budget more time and workers for their software products YEARS in advance. That, or actually let the software people dictate the pace of their work. But I don't think they're going to ever do that because they can just crunch their team of devs to death to put out something economically adaquate. I bet the devs are pulling their hair out at being forced to release software that's so subpar because they clearly put so much work into this game, it just wasn't nearly enough work relative the unreasonable scope set for them by the brand-level creative team.\n\nThis is just my hypothesis for what it's worth. But I feel like this whole situation makes more sense if you think of Pokemon's brand less like Call of Duty and more like Sanrio, because that's who they're really competing with.\n\nEDIT: Figuring out who is to blame isn't important and not my point here. It's just that in a huge corporation like this decisions are made from the top down not the bottom up and I don't think everyone gets that.","score":6940,"comments":[{"body":"To be fair, I've seen a lot more people criticize The Pok√©mon Company or whoever's decision it was to push the game out too soon than Game Freak this time around when compared with Sword &amp; Shield.","score":743,"comments":[{"body":"Game Freak's weird City game wasn't hindered by a draconian schedule and still came out to a resounding thud, so I don't think its *just* TPC.","score":155,"comments":[{"body":"Little Town Hero was so forgettable people don't even remember how boring it was or that it even exists.

By the time you have done that the sandwich has gotten cold and its not as enjoyable anymore. In the end you question why the chef decided not to remove the shell before serving the sandwich to you. Then you look around the restaurants and some of the customers are just straight up walking out(refunds) and some are defending the chef because \"they didn't have time to remove the shell. It's hard to make lobster.\" Then I, as a customer, feel very conflicted, because the few bites of sandwich I've had have been super delicious, one of the best sandwiches in a while, but the way the sandwich was presented just makes it so hard to enjoy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's what these games are. The core gameplay is actually really fun. But with so performance issues: (low fps and fps drops, long loading times, delays after every action, weird visual bugs) and things that feel half finished: (goofy animations, no voice acting, no entering town buildings, limited character customization) it makes the game really hard to enjoy and support.\n\nI don't think I regret my purchase, because at the end of the day it is still a fun game, it is just really disappointing because it was so close to being one of the best switch games of all time and instead it just feels like another unfinished unpolished Pok√©mon game. \n\nI'm even more conflicted about recommending the game. I think it is worth playing, but at the same time I want the next game to not have these fundamental issues, so I fear by supporting these games we are allowing this to continue.","score":11,"comments":[{"body":"I will reply to this with my last affirmation:  \n\n\n\"See, the thing is: i don't really mind the low FPS, ALTHOUGH we should, in theory, get at least a non-dropping 40 (at LEAST)  \nWhat bothers me is i feel like i run around aimlessly doing the same thing as in BDSP: Catching for the dex, collecting useless items (mostly, but that might have to do with me having 3 badges only) and not following a storyline.The reason BOTW works as an open world is because you get constant action and not just \\*A\\* button mashing to kill every pokemon just to.. what, keep running?Yes, i'm well aware that i should be going for gyms and starfall street challenges, don't get me wrong, but the game doesn't \"push\" you to do that. And THIS is what's being considered the \"Endgame\" (no battle tower afaik, no new \"challenge\" like the ones offered in CT + IoA, no secret trainer from the anime lore, like red, and virtually no co-op because you can't just random queue).  \nWhat i mean is: if you're tailoring a massive franchise in which your main customers are 30+ dads, make the game HARD and CHALLENGING. There's a reason why Hard Nuzzlockers + impossible games are REALLY fun to watch. Knowledge deep and strats pushed to the edge by rando trainers.  \nWhat bothers me is: if you're going to go \"no level scaling\", then level scale the areas in pattern and at random. So, say i'm going for gym 2: It would be an obvious tell, and not a fun gamble, if i ran into level 22\\~25 pok√©mon, because i'd know that their levels are scaled around the area gym) - hence why i favor level scaling, at least until the last gym.  \nTime is past, also, that victory road is lvl 95+, so we are forced to level and exploration becomes MEANINGFUL, as we need to reach VR with a decent team. Some good AI changes to make the game harder are in order, too.  \nMy real concern is: I'm not having FUN. It's low tier fun, but i'm gonna get tired of running around in 2 days and probably just hit the gyms in the obvious order, since they're predictable, run the game over and... well, then what do i do?  \nLuckily i LOVE ranked/VGC tournaments, so i'm not hasty because i wanna get to know the pok√©mons before i assemble a couple of teams and try some strats, but i'm gonna be honest, for people that don't PVP, it feels mindless.  \nJust my 10 cents here.\"","score":4,"comments":[]},{"body":"\n&gt;Then you look around the restaurants and some of the customers are just straight up walking out(refunds) and some are defending the chef because \"they didn't have time to remove the shell.

You can spend like, two hours pressing A to learn the absolute basics about pokemon mechanics (which is a good intention but what kid will willingly do that?) and sometimes you can chit-chat with a teacher to raise your bond with them to get...basically nothing.\n\nThis is so god damn frustrating. Game Freaks! Give us some love! Give us a fleshed out school! As of now, the rooms serve no prupose 99% of the time, what a waste.\n\nIn a world better than this one, imagine.\n\nYou get introduced to the pokemon academy. You present yourself to your classmates and you see at least half of them have interesting designs. Their quips give you a bit on information about their personalities. Classes are pretty good as they are now, but CLUBS!\n\nHere you can go to mutiple club rooms, each tied with a game mechanic. The fishing club is pretty self explanatory. The occult club tries to solve mysteries linked to ghsot pokemons. The gardening club will teach you everything about growing berries! The photography club gives a gameplay purpose to the selfie option. The pokemon combat club makes you battle gimmicky teams (like a entre FEAR strat team, a stall team, a team full of SubSeed-style pokemons, a team of metamorphs). The pokemon gardery is where you leave your pokemons when at school because you are not permitted to have them out of their pokeballs *so here's a daycare center you're welcome*. The cyclizard club is all about doing sanctionned runs (remember how they mention team star making \\*llegal runs but no mentions of legal runs are to be found?).\n\nWith each of these clubs, there is a NPC in your class that will guide you. Not anything more in-depth than the other roads, just simple dialogue. And each of these clubs give you quests. Yeah, quests!  \nThe occult club finds the key to an abandonned tower and tries to get to the end of that old tower, an ancient cemetary used for pokemons, full of ghost-types.  \nThe fishing club hosts a contest! You have to catch the \"best\" pokemon of a give specie in a give timeframe (several in-game days). To calculate, the jury takes in account the IVs of the pok√©mon.  \nThe photography club asks you to go around and take pictures of landscape including one or several pokemons. You even get a huge bonus if you manage to take the picture of a shiny mon!  \nThe gardening club tasks you with planting specific berries in specific places, triggering the apparition of some species of pokemons in that place.\n\nAnd every time you and the \"plotline\" of one of those club, or even one of the three main quests, you get a Tm and a nice little trophy to decorate your bedroom with! Posters, plushies, actual trophies for the champion road. There are SO. MANY.

Or even jut a static display that fills up more and more akin to a trophy room.\n\nHell, use that bond system for something. *Anything*.

For anyone who would prefer to watch or listen to that, or anyone who wants to see visual examples of some of the points below, I'll leave a link [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJY0zXgEr0I).*\n\nThe last few days have seen a lot of discussion around Scarlet and Violet, with lots of people bringing up fair points of both praise and criticism. I think it's important to bring up the fact that there are plenty of things that are great about the new games, but also several things that simply need to be better. But with so many people weighing in their opinions on the game, often leaning heavily into one sided, I've compiled all of these opinions and discussion points around the game in the hope that some people will find a new perspective they hadn‚Äôt considered, and those who are yet to play it will have a full picture of what Scarlet and Violet do right and what they do wrong. And it‚Äôs also worth noting that some of these features will be much more significant to some than others. Things like story and graphics can be very subjective, but the fact remains that Pok√©mon has an immense audience and what might be less important to you may matter a great deal to others.\n\nI‚Äôll be avoiding spoilers as much as possible, with any relevant points marked as such.\n\n# The Good\n\n##### Open World \n* Paldea features a sprawling open world environment, and to its credit, the games do a good job of incentivising and rewarding exploration. I would often stray from the main route, and I often encountered useful items or new species of Pok√©mon for doing so.\n \n* The variety and density of Pok√©mon ‚Äì both new and old ‚Äì was enough to keep things fresh throughout.\n\n* Finding groups of Pok√©mon in natural habitats helped to sell the idea of Paldea as a living world.\n\n* The Spanish influences are very well executed - Scarlet and Violet have some of the most visually interesting towns in the franchise in my opinion.\n\n##### Pok√©mon, Story and Characters\n\n* The designs are subjective, but generally I feel like there‚Äôs a good selection of new Pok√©mon ‚Äì particularly the starters. It doesn't seem like there's a clear favourite or clear weak link between the three this time around.\n\n* The story in Scarlet and Violet feels like a considerable upgrade over Generations 7 and 8.\n\n* The fact that the main story is split up into three major questlines, with each offering variation in gameplay and reward, helps add some much-needed variety. Some are better executed than others, but it's nice to see new iterations of previous gameplay styles, like totem Pok√©mon in the Path of Legends story.\n\n* While Nemona is yet another iteration of the ‚Äòfriendly rival‚Äô like Hau and Hop, she's far less abrasive than either of them ever were. Arven will be a popular one as well as he seems a much more genuine side character than we've often seen before. A handful of the lesser characters, like the gym leaders, have lots of personality too. \n\n* Koraidon and Miraidon feel much more like partners to the main character than Zacian and Zamazenta ever did.\n\n##### Quality of Life\n\n* Trainer battles in the open world being completely optional removes a lot of tedium from required battles. \n\n* Lots of the features that were added to the Pok√©mon centre staff in Sword and Shield, such as remembering moves and changing nicknames, can now be done straight from the menu.\n\n* The dynamic camera in wild Pok√©mon battles alongside the cinematic camera in story battles offers some nice variety.\n\n##### Co-op\n\n* The co-op is well executed: players can continue their own storylines independently of other players in their world. Guests won‚Äôt be forced to watch story cutscenes or wait for certain events to trigger before continuing their own adventures - activities are seamless, which vastly improves the use of co-op during the main story.\n\n* Not many barriers - pretty much everything you can do in a solo scenario, you can do in co-op.\n\nOverall, Scarlet and Violet are very enjoyable games. The core open world gameplay is fun and engaging, the story and characters are elevated from past generations, and there are plenty of things to do with new and old Pok√©mon during the course of the main game.\n\n# The Bad\n\n##### Performance and Bugs\n\n* Let's just get it out of the way. These games do **NOT** run well. Frequent frame drops and slowdown is common.\n\n* NPCs and models will run at a lower framerate when far from the player, meaning that choppy animations are everywhere. We've all seen the windmills, the classroom scene, etc.\n\n* Slowdown is worse around cities, or during weather events like rain or sandstorm. One suspected cause is a memory leak which causes game performance to dip while in or around cities ‚Äì at present, it remains to be seen if or when this will be addressed.\n\n* Many textures and shadows look jagged, and there are numerous instances where the lighting flickers or changes suddenly. I've seen some people reporting motion sickness as a result of flickering textures and graphics.\n\n* Many reports of crashes - I encountered one during the first gym challenges.  \n\n* Wild Pok√©mon suddenly popping in moments before I ran into them was a common occurrence which quickly became tedious.\n\n* When riding Koraidon or Miraidon, it's common to get stuck on terrain or experience bugged interactions.\n\n* Co-op is particularly bug-ridden. While playing co-op I encountered faulty animations, instances where other players would appear in mid-air, visual glitches, and so on.\n\nCompared to other open world games on the Switch like Breath of the Wild and Xenoblade Chronicles, it‚Äôs fair to say that the severity of these performance issues is exclusive to Scarlet and Violet rather than a result of the hardware of the Nintendo Switch. While the problems won't be enough to truly damper someone's enjoyment of the game, it's impossible to ignore the problems.\n\n##### Difficulty and Level Balance\n\n* Once again, difficulty is non-existent in this Generation. And while not terribly surprising, it‚Äôs much more noticeable this time around. I found myself having to skip the overwhelming majority of trainer battles, as well as rotate members of my team, in order to keep my levels in line with those of the story bosses. \n\n* The game features linear scaling ‚Äì meaning that the levels of gym leaders and other story battles do not scale in accordance with what you‚Äôve accomplished around the map. If you choose to face the 1st gym after beating the 2nd, you‚Äôll find yourself vastly over levelled fighting Pok√©mon weaker than the previous gym challenge. And given the open world design of these games, it‚Äôs incredibly easy to inadvertently do things out of order, unless you‚Äôre constantly asking what your next goal should be at the Pok√©mon center. When the difference between one gym challenge and another can be as little as two or three levels, it‚Äôs easy to complete objectives in an order different than what the game expects, and encounter a pitifully easy gym challenge as a result. It would have been better if the levels of the story encounters the player was expected to have cleared earlier would scale to match the level of the hardest challenge they‚Äôve already beaten. That way the game would continue to incentivise its open world nature without enforcing such a strict route through the game‚Äôs challenges.\n\n##### Towns\n\n* As far as gameplay goes, the towns and cities are incredibly underwhelming. When arriving in a town, the first thing I would do would be to explore, pick up any items I could find, and tackle the gym challenge if a gym was present.\n\n* The large majority of buildings in Paldea cannot be accessed, and even the biggest towns in the region would feature maybe one or two relevant NPCs. What this ultimately means is that if a town doesn‚Äôt have a story objective tied to it, a player will spend a few minutes picking up any useful items before leaving and never coming back. \n\n##### Customisation\n\n* While the customisation options at the start of the game are a plus, customisation has been massively stripped down from previous games.\n\n* The player is pretty much stuck with a school child appearance. While the game‚Äôs story attempts to justify this, the main rival Nemona is in the same class as the main character while looking much more like a young adult. It‚Äôs a bit of a let down that there‚Äôs no option to create a young adult character. \n\n* More importantly, clothing options are extremely limited. Players have the choice of one of four school uniforms from the start of the game, but can only change other accessories like glasses and shoes freely. No options to change tops, overwear or bottoms unlike previous games.\n\n##### Other missing features\n\n* For some reason, players can no longer disable battle animations.\n\n* The option to change the battle mode to set is missing as well, though can technically still be implemented by just turning down every offer to switch. This is far from practical though.\n\n* Post-game &gt;!Once the main story has concluded, there‚Äôs no sign of a Battle Tower or similar substitute available. To see more popular options like the Battle Frontier neglected yet again, and the compromise that used to be the Battle Tower discarded as well is really disappointing.!&lt;\n\nUltimately, there‚Äôs a lot of great features in this new Pok√©mon adventure: the transition to an open world may still have some growing pains, but the core gameplay is enjoyable. This is arguably the most innovation the series has seen in some time, and Pok√©mon fans should celebrate what this new region has improved over the past few iterations.\n\nHowever, that‚Äôs not to say that these games are not without their problems. The performance issues will rightfully continue to plague these games ‚Äì it‚Äôs impossible to ignore the fact that the current state of Scarlet and Violet on release is just not good enough. While you can muster any number of excuses for this: such as poor management or release schedules aligned with the anime and TCG. But ultimately, finding someone to blame is not what‚Äôs important, the fact remains that this is one of the core products of the entire franchise: expecting a functional product is the bare minimum. And that‚Äôs before you consider issues concerning gameplay, design and missing content. It‚Äôs important to recognise the standards that Scarlet and Violet fail to meet, just as much as its important to praise what they do well. Because these games have important learnings for both Game Freak and Pok√©mon fans alike.\n\nIf there are any points I've missed, add it below and I'll update the main post.","score":9,"comments":[{"body":"I would also mention the breeding changes from daycare to the camp ‚Äúpicnic‚Äù system - which isn‚Äôt really explained at all by the game as far as I can tell.

Breeding has always been the one thing where they've always managed to either improve the QoL or keep it mostly the same. At this point it has to have been done on purpose.\n\nFor those unaware of the new mechanics:\n\n* You now have to AFK in order to generate eggs. This means you can no longer hatch eggs while simultaneously obtaining more, vastly increasing the amount of time it takes to obtain hatched Pokemon.\n* Eggs generated while AFK cap at 10. This means you still have to check the game every few minutes, leading to the awful combination of being forced to pay attention to the game while unable to actually play it.\n* You can no longer hatch multiple eggs simultaneously. If you have multiple eggs in your party that were obtained at the same time, you need to complete a new egg cycle each time one hatches - even if they're all ready to hatch.\n* There are no longer any indicators for when an egg is available, how compatible your Pokemon are, how much time Egg/Hatching Power has remaining, or when Egg/Hatching Power has expired.\n\nThis might not be a big deal to many players, but as someone who's had hundreds of hours shiny breeding in each game since XY this is a huge blow to how much time and enjoyment I'll get out of the game. Gamefreak clearly understands what the gameplay experience is like and how to improve it, and there's no justification for regressing this much. It's the same as removing the sound/particle effect when a Shiny spawns - the QoL has been made significantly worse for no reason. I don't know if they're planning to release a daycare in the DLC, or just phase breeding out of the games in favor of Bottle Caps, or what, but regressing this much is just miserable.\n\nYou should definitely do your breeding in a different game if you can, and then just transfer up once HOME is out. Good luck to those of you going for shiny Paldean starters, you'll need it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT, for clarification:\n\nAn egg cycle is NOT the full time it takes an egg to hatch, it's the set number of steps it takes for an egg to progress its hatch timer (which then varies based on Pokemon species). In prior games, it takes 1 step for an egg to hatch once it has 0 egg cycles remaining. In SV it takes another full egg cycle, which is an additional \\~20-30 seconds per egg. (This is also how the Flame Body ability works! It doubles the amount of egg cycles deducted while walking, rather than changing the hatch time of each and every Pokemon species).\n\nI'd also like to clarify that this specifically is a problem for Shiny breeding, which takes hundreds or thousands of eggs and is the only way to obtain Shinies of Pokemon that don't appear in the wild (such as the starters). Casual breeding of 10 or fewer eggs isn't really affected by this change, but breeding large numbers is certainly a much longer and less time-efficient process than it was in prior titles - and most of that time is spent staring at the screen unable to press buttons!","score":1454,"comments":[{"body":"They seem to be stepping away from breeding as a means of getting the best pokemon, using items that modify existing pokemon instead.","score":2145,"comments":[{"body":"Which personally is so SO much better. \n\nThey just need to make it easier to get the items necessary to create a competitive team.

Fine, I'll just beat them - and then run out of PP in the middle of nowhere, forcing me to fly back and redo my trekk to the next town. At some point, I was just trying to dart to the next town as fast as possible, only to be disappointing by how lacking the town is, and then dart to the gym. This is the main gameplay loop of the Victory Road path and it's not nearly as involved as it was in past gens.\n\nThe actual gyms themselves are also very lackluster. They are just basketball courts copy pasted 8 times. You don't really have to do much except play a mini game. Every gym is the exact same. Remember when there were puzzles? When I saw that first gym I couldn't contain my laughter. You just Rocket League a ball into a net in 3 seconds. THAT was the \"test\" to prove myself worthy to fight the gym leader? Finding three random guys on the map? Playing Simon Says? The gyms have *NO* design, it's the same battle court *every time*. The Gym Leaders couldn't be any more uninteresting.\n\nSet/Switch option is gone, meaning you are now told which pokemon is next and always given the option to switch... making the ONE difficulty choice the games ALWAYS had now impossible to do. I've seen people say \"Just mash B so you don't have to switch!\". Great, now I accidentally skipped a Pok√©mon trying to learn a move. Fantastic.\n\nThe EXP share can't be turned off but that goes without saying these days. It's still a major problem, it trivializes leveling up Pok√©mon. For most of the game, I was just fighting with my starter, with the rest of the team getting stronger without really participating or doing anything.\n\nThe story has a couple okay characters and the motivation of the villains is not as dumb as the ones in sword and shield, thank God, but its still not very noteworthy, feels like an afterthought. I think Nemona and especially Arven &gt;!trying to heal poor Mabosstiff!&lt; make for some really neat characters and Team Star's true reason for dropping out of school do as well, but it's a joke to suggest that they are even close to the writing and themes BW and B2W2 provided for the player.\n\nSpeaking of Team Star, they are students, just like you, so the only distinction they even have is... their goofy helmet. Needless to say, at the very least in the older games, you could tell the teams apart from regular people more visually. The enemy team is literally just students who put on a helmet with a star on. I really dislike Team Flare but even *that* team had a *design.* You can tell a Team Flare member apart from other trainer classes. Team Star looks like a random bicycle-riding trainer class.\n\nPlaying the game is really tedious because of the long load times and countless waiting periods between battles and actions. I found myself starting over on an emulator instead to play on 300% speed to level myself up quickly, as the default Switch version is just wasting your time unnecessarily.\n\nNotice how I didn't even talk about bugs that much? Because even if all the bugs were fixed the game is still mediocre at best. I played the game so I could discuss it properly (and because I was hoping that its NOT worse than Sword and Shield) but the small indie team over at Game Freak is still trying to find its footing with a limited budget so it's all fine /s","score":23,"comments":[{"body":"Everyone still talking about everything except the pokeballs in thr doorways","score":11,"comments":[{"body":"","score":0,"comments":[]}]},{"body":"&gt; Set/Switch option is gone, meaning you are now told which pokemon is next and always given the option to switch... making the ONE difficulty choice the games ALWAYS had now impossible to do.\n\nThis made me laugh here.\n\nThere are people asking for different difficulty settings, and okay, we can argue that it might not be the majority of the fans.

Just using the very first Pokemon game, I can think of Viridian Forest, Lavender Town, The Safari Zone, The power plant, that one route with all the board walks, etc etc. \n\nYeah pokemon spawn in batched areas, but those areas were a lot more visually distinct areas with distinct ways of navigating them and most had their own personality.

Reloading the raid page seems to be set to a timer of 3-5 minutes, which is pretty abysmal. As soon as I reload the page and try to join a raid, over half the time they're already full. Compile that with the fact that just joining a lobby takes at least a full minute of connecting, before I'm then told the lobby is full, I can rarely even join a raid in the first place.

If my Pokemon faints, I get a timer of 5s until they respawn, but most of the time it's double or even triple that. As soon as the battle starts, there are times I can't even select a move before the window disappears to display some teammate or enemy move text and my Pok√©mon is just sitting there taking hits. Too frequently does the move window randomly reset, so as I'm mashing A trying to select the super-effective move in time before the window closes, it sometimes jumps to the top of the move list and I select the wrong move, not the one I just used moments before. If the team wipes, I get to watch a white screen for a minute before I get sent back to the overworld. If we beat the Pok√©mon and it has no health often they like to do another move, just because for some reason, and maybe kill my Pok√©mon, so I have to go through a faint animation before I can catch them.

It was a little tough figuring out where to go because there were so many mesa-like levels of elevation in there, but I battled my way to the top, and got to destroy the psychic. Mission accomplished. It was a great personal goal. \n\nSome people told me I wasn't *supposed* to do that, but Gamefreak *said* I could in their marketing, so Gamefreak was right. and I used everything that was present in the game to do it so it's all above board. (Can anyone confirm that I actually wasn't supposed to be there?)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis leads to my completely serious bullet points, conclusions, and next steps:\n\n* I read that if you get to the towns before going to the school, all the gyms are locked, titan areas are not operational and team star places are empty. That tells me that Gamefreak knew about the almighty power of pokemon battling and went out of their way to ensure THAT part of the progression wasnt ruined. Friends, we might be a few years away from Gamefreak cannonizing that pokeballs let players teleport... Or something. Anyway, pretty sure they knew about that quirk and they guarded against it.\n* It actually isn't all that hard to survive traveling to those far out places. If you have type advantage, your level 30 pokemon can take on the level 40-42 wild ones with minimal cost if they auto-battle. That helped get me get them gym ready.\n* Randoms in the town kept talking about how the Cyclizars were the reason they could get to that town. Well, if some randoms can do it, then I'm a hundred percent happy to use the almighty power of pokemon battles to do it, since my red lizard friend isn't good enough out of the box.\n* I read people bothered about how the challenge of the game is thrown off if you decide to be a trailblazer and comply with Gamefreak's promise of charting your own course. Yeah, I do think they could do some conditional parties based on how many badges you had, but I'm biased. I worked on an RMPX pokemon game years ago, and coding the Gym Leaders to have 8 different parties based on badge count wasn't all that hard. It's a simple if,else, or switch case statement. The hardest part would be planning the eight parties, but when I say 'hard' I just mean one intern's afternoon is more busy.\n* Met Nemona at the gym where she explained to me how things worked. I'm glad to know that Gamefreak does in fact know how to check if any gym is the first gym you entered. \n* I plan to just study the gym leader's teams and just switch out my party as according to their levels. I'm not in the mood to bully adults, y'know? Unless they're psychics.\n* I don't mind doing the above, because I kind of already have to study competitors and market trends anyway, so studying the teams doesn't really break immersion for me.\n* Sending out fuecoco to utterly incinerate roaming herds of gogoat was incredibly satisfying\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll in all, the game is as fun as you can make it.

It's really annoying to have a level 40+ team and having to go back to level 10s when you miss an area. I WISH this game had more dynamic levelling. But it's not 100% bad.\n\nWhen playing the older games, or a game that universally raised levels as time went on, it felt like it locked you in to the pokemon you had already picked. If you were in a level 30 area and wanted to add a level 8 pokemon to your team, you either did a lot of grinding to get it up to speed or you just stuck with whatever level 30+ pokemon you already had. And the amount of time spent leveling up a pokemon meant you could only really focus on your main 6 and not any more. Exp share helped reduce the grind and being able to swap out team members, but it still made trying to make new teams harder.\n\nThis especially sucks when it comes to new pokemon.

I also don't want to run through a new game using only older pokemon I like. I want to use my faves but if I'm using 4-5 pokemon I've used before and only 1-2 new pokemon, it gets repetitive.\n\nIn this game I don't have to worry. Did I just move from a level 40 are to a level 10 area? New team time! I get to try out all those new pokemon I caught at level 10 but haven't used yet! I never would've bothered with Smolliv or Tandemaus or Fidough if they had to be one of my main 6 pokemon but since I got to keep switching out for lower level pokemon and trying out new ones, I actually got to use them and I love them and their evolutions. \n\nI know this might be more of a me thing and that a lot of people want to focus on a single team of their faves, but if it's getting boring for you to keep fighting with your level 50+ pokemon, try using something else!

In more than a few aspects. Theres alot to discuss, but I'm gonna focus on how the game looks, because thats what brought me to comment on here.\n\nAll the comments saying the game is ugly, ps1 graphics etc. are heavily influenced by the unfortunately bland starting areas. To put it bluntly, the game has been gorgeous more times than it has been unpleasant to look at. \n\nWhat really drove me to post this was reaching Tagtree Thicket in the game for the first time. A thick, shady wooded area with painted trees, full to bursting with pokemon that all feel incredibly alive. New spidermon jumping down from the trees, tiny foongus you can barely notice crawling around you, impidimp scurrying faster than other pokemon, surpise zorua from random pokemon encounters, etc. \n\nThe life and vibrancy people are experiencing in this game is nothing like we've ever experienced, not even in PLA. That can't be conveyed in still screenshots, and try as I might, my post probably wont do it justice either. The fact that people are basing so much of what they're saying on still shots, or on early game footage (where the game has looked the worst so far imo, and where alot of the lighting bugs are) is tragic and frankly misleading.\n\nIf you want more examples, West Areas have a great, almost tolkien-esque bgm that pairs so well with their rolling hills and open fields (could use more mons though), east grassland and coastal areas are scenic and alive with herds of lively pokemon, and beaches are full to bursting with area appropriate and useful mons (latter is true everywhere i think). \n\nHell even the bland asado desert area has an amazing combination of shimmering sand, random sandstorms that seemed to come and go even during battle, and pokemon heads poking out of the sand dunes, all more than enough to distract you from the bad rock textures. And say what you will about the  mine areas with garbage caves, but the carkoal herds, tumbleweed mons, and exploding voltorbs still give it so much life.\n\nTo keep it straight, the game absolutely runs like crap, and if stability patches arent put out, I would definitely be worried. But I feel like alot of fans are missing out on so much because they're being mislead into thinking the game is absolutely unplayable, or that the narrative is 1 step-forward, 2 steps back. \n\nBy now the number of people who are enjoying the game should attest to its playability, and I suspect more will come out in the next few weeks to voice their opinions after they've had their fun. \n\nAs for the step analogy, from my experience its been maybe 5 steps forward, and 1 or 2 back.
