And it was so. \n\n8 Garry called the vault “ceiling.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the second day. \n\n9 And Garry said, “Let the wood under the sky be gathered to one place, and let 64 squares appear.” And it was so. \n\n10 Garry called the 64 squares “okay,” and the gathered wood he called “pieces.” And Garry saw that it was good. \n\n11 Then Garry said, “Let the board produce pawns: en-passanting minions and tools on the board that promote to bigger things, according to their various kinds.” And it was so. \n\n12 The board produced pawns: pawns promoting according to their kinds and pawns en-passanting other pawns according to their kinds. And Garry saw that it was good. \n\n13 And there was evening, and there was morning—the third day. \n\n14 And Garry said, “Let there be Stockfish in the vault of the ceiling to separate the Liers players from the True, and let it serve as a sign to mark PIPI in pampers, and always playing Fair, and meeting in Court,\n\n15 and let it be Stockfish in the vault of the ceiling to give help to Tigran L. Petrosian.” And it was so. \n\n16 Garry made two great Stockfish—the greater ceiling to govern the Petrosian and the lesser anal bead to govern the Niemann. He also made the Lichess Opening Explorer. \n\n17 Garry set them in the vault of the ceiling to give Stockfish on the board, \n\n18 to govern the white and the black, and to separate Tigran L. Petrosian from Wesley So. And Garry saw that it was good. \n\n19 And there was evening, and there was morning—the fourth day. \n\n20 And Garry said, “Let the board teem with bishops, and let knights fly above the earth across the vault of the sky.” \n\n21 So Garry created the great bishops of the diagonals and every diagonally moving thing with which the board teems and that moves about in it, according to their kinds, and every L-moving knight according to its kind. And Garry saw that it was good. \n\n22 Garry blessed them and said, “Be obedient and capture each other and fianchetto on the diagonal on the board, and let the knights jump over other pieces.” \n\n23 And there was evening, and there was morning—the fifth day. \n\n24 And Garry said, “Let the board produce more pieces according to their kinds: the kings, the rooks that move in a straight line, and the queens, each according to its kind.” And it was so. \n\n25 Garry made the kings according to their kinds, the rooks according to their kinds, and the queens that move along the ground in any direction they wish. And Garry saw that it was good. \n\n26 Then Garry said, “Let us make players in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the knights and the bishops in the sky, over the kings and all the rooks, and over all the queens that move in any direction they wish.” \n\n27 So Garry created players in his own image, in the image of Garry he created them; male and female he created them. \n\n28 Garry blessed them and said to them, “Be aggressive and increase in elo; crush noobs and brick your enemies. Cheat in tournaments and post funny responses on the Chess.com, use anal beads and cause drama, drunkenly challenge Eric Hansen to a fight.” \n\n29 Then Garry said, “I give r/AnarchyChess every other meme-bearing tournament on the face of the whole earth and every player that has drama with Hikaru. They will be yours for Memes. \n\n30 And to all the r/Chess users of the earth and all the r/ChessBeginners and all the Chess.com players that move along around 600 elo—everyone that has not the slightest bit of life in themselves—I give the London System.” And it was so. \n\n31 Garry saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning—the sixth day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow you might be asking, what about the New Testament?

The cafe was running a particularly attractive deal for a delicious breakfast, and the brochure made the food look very enticing. So that morning I hurried along to the cafe to make sure I would get a decent table sitting on the pavement to enjoy my meal amongst the bustle of the Parisian morning.\n\nTo my surprise the cafe was quiter than I expected, so I was able to get my preferred seat, but it was a bit concerning that a decent cafe like this would be so empty. In hindsight that was the first sign that something was wrong. Soon the waiter approached and I asked for the breakfast special that I had seen in the brochure. He grunted dismissively as he took my order and hurried away. Another concerning sign, although at the time I didn't think much of it.\n\nMy concern grew as the time passed without any sign of my food. It had been close to an hour and I still had not been served. At this point I was beginning to get quite hungry and frankly a bit agitated. I waved my waiter over to ask where my breakfast was and he ducked away, again in a hurried and unpleasant fashion. Moments later he returned. I still remember the disappointment I felt at that time. This breakfast that I had been looking forward to quickly evaporated into a wholly disappointing experience. Instead of the plate of delicious French pastries and condiments that was promised, I was served a single, dull, doughy mess in the shape of a crescent - a cheap imitation of what I had expected.

Then en passant Georgia, get good barbecue for your gators and use that to take over the rest of America. In Canada you need to fight the moose god so you’ll want to go down to Mexico and en passant the chupacabra into submission then when you go back to Canada the moose God’ll start pipi in his pampers and now you’ve finally set up good pawn structure on the left side of the board. Use that to en passant over the pacific into Japan and become supreme ruler of the waifus. Pimp out your waifus to strong government officials involving yourself with corrupt politics. In the meantime your pawns from North America will take over South America which gives access to better drugs. Have your pimped out waifus get the government officials hooked on those drugs. Now they are addicted to drugs and sex and will do anything you say. Bam you’ve taken over Japan, Korea, and all East Asian countries just like that. Unfortunately the holy camel spirit of the Middle East is blocking your path into Europe and Africa. This is when you have to go back to America and find the reclusive Baldest Eagle. His lack of hair will make him perfect for the Middle East since the sun will shine on his bald head, blinding any who look at it. With that you’ll defeat the holy camel spirit. To take over Europe the first place you go to is France to learn the true meaning of en passant. Once you Google en passant and learn it means in passing in France all of Europe will have no choice but to bow before your overwhelming might. Finally you have to defeat Africa. Since you’ve taken over the Middle East you already have Egypt and using the pyramids you’ll have to contact the aliens and see if they’ll provide support.
