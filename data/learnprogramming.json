A means to an end. In a way - it's no different knowing your preferred desktop OS. \n\nYou need to have a basic understanding of where things are and how to interact with them. And just like learning an OS it usually comes over time vs a tutorial. That's because it's not really a skill - it's more of an understanding.\n\nObviously, the first thing is the terminal. In this context that's the number one way you'll be interacting with it. Locally, that's macOS's terminal or Window's WSL. Or, Docker on your local system. This is a tools in itself and you should 'own' it. Take the time to customize it your liking. It's very easy to do and makes your life a lot better.\n\nThen you have basic file system navigation. Where are config files stored? Where are the binaries (executables/programs)? How you list files and directories? How do you navigate to them? How do you view or edit them?\n\nFrom there it's getting used to Bash. Let's look at an simple example.\n\nWP CLI is a cli tool for WordPress. It allows you to do stuff via the command line that you either can't do (easily) otherwise or do it faster. \n\nThe install directions:\n\n    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wp-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/wp-cli.phar\n\nIf you don't have any experience in Linux this is just nonsense. But, if you have any experience this is a common command and install method.\n\n`curl` - simplified - is like a web request with out a browser. `-O` is a flag. It tells curl to save the results instead of outputting them to the terminal. So, this command calls that url and saves the file.\n\nSave it where? Another thing that comes from experience. Your context in the CLI is almost always where you at the moment. If you run that command in the `/some/random/directory` it will save the file there.\n\n    php wp-cli.phar --info\n\nThis assumes you already have PHP installed on this system. `php` is the binary. This command is telling PHP to run `wp-cli.phar` and `--info` tell it to output information about itself.\n\n    chmod +x wp-cli.phar. \n    sudo mv wp-cli.phar /usr/local/bin/wp\n\n`chmod` tells Linux to make this file executable - specifically with the `+x` flag. But the command itself is about permissions. Who can read, write, edit, or run.\n\n`sudo` is telling Linux to run the `mv` command as admin. Higher permissions. Why? Because you are moving it to a more global area intended to be used by any user on the system. `mv` is move but also acts as the renaming function in Linux. Now that our file is executable lets move it to space all users can access. And let's rename it so we don't have to type all those characters. \n\n---\n\nI'm sure people will come in behind me and say I'm technically wrong about this or that. And they aren't wrong. But it doesn't *really* matter most times. The important part is that this simple task isn't foreign to me.\n\nWhen you're starting out a lot of your interaction will be tooling. Most frameworks using CLI to generate projects or build assets or whatever. If you're looking for a bug and somebody asks you if you've \"tailled the log file\" that shouldn't confuse you. Where are log files stored and what is `tail`? `tail -f /var/log/php/error.log` just allows you to view the log in real time as it gets written to.\n\nYou don't need to know Linux like a System Administrator. But you should know like how to use it like you know your desktop OS. In the above example it's the same task as installing an `.exe` on Windows. Instead of downloading an installer and doubeclicking you run a few commands in the terminal.\n\nMy first real experience was years ago. And, honestly, kinda outside what a dev should do, but we often find ourselves in that situation. Was working at a small web shop that had no backups for all our client sites. I took it upon myself to make that happen.\n\nIt took me one week to do the following:\n\n* install Linux on some hardware we had\n* setup SSH so I could log in remotely from my desk\n* write a Bash script that would\n * SSH into our production server\n * `rsync` the files from the production server to the local server\n* write another Bash script that would automatically\n * tarball (like .zip) the backups into weekly and monthly\n * remove old weekly and monthly\n* put those two Bash scripts into Cron (runs Bash scripts on a schedule - part of Linux)\n\nThat is a trivial task for a System Admin. Even now I could probably still get it done in under a day. But it was a huge undertaking for me at the time.\n\nBeing a \"master\" Linux user is never going to secure you a dev job. However, having a base level understanding and ability to accomplish basic tasks is expected. Perhaps not as a fresh graduate or new hire - but very quickly in your career. And if you happen to develop those skills they can be a nice selling point for hiring you over somebody else.","score":74,"comments":[{"body":"","score":0,"comments":[]}]},{"body":"The reason Linux is important is because most of the world runs on it.

I messed around with html and CSS here and there, command line stuff. Remained at that same level of technological skills throughout junior high/high school years. Never got into full on programming until about 2018 (age 23 ?). That is when I started to write python for fun and got really into it, learned some JavaScript too, focused more heavily on python. Fast forward a year and I got a job at a small company duplicating RFID fobs because I had python on my resume and they could hire me on cheap, for a customer service position with my python skills as a bonus to help automate things (job wasn't all programming, primarily customer service, but I would be doing some programming on the side) I built a pretty crappy but working automation for the RFID fob duplication device (Proxmark 3) which involved some python scripting using subprocess etc and slightly customising an implementation of the C firmware of the RFID duplication device, to work better with said python scripts to automate the process for copying data of various RFID protocols. I left there after I felt I was a) bored of the project and b) underpaid ($20/hr, Canadian). But ever since then I have been programming anywhere from a few times a week to daily and have a few pretty cool side projects going, but I feel like for the amount of time I have been coding just does not stack up to my skillset. I asked a question on YouTube today that kind of made me feel like damn, I really don't know shit and I've been programming for how long? I asked this after a night of no sleep to be fair but it just made me feel like such a noob.\n\nThe question was related to tRPC and a possible equivelant setup for non typescript backend.\n\nQuestion I asked was:\"So - if i have an app where i am bound to using python on the backend for (django), how would I get something similar to tRPC? I am currently just going to use GraphQL but is there any way to get a similar setup to T3 stack with a python backend? Is my only option for something that measures up to go typescript backend?\"\n\nTo which the obvious answer was:\"Python is not typesafe. You can‚Äôt infer types from a language that isn‚Äôt typesafe lol\"\n\nwhich to be fair, I was thinking of mypy or the likes for enforcing pseudo type safety, but even then, its obviously a noob question. I just felt so embarrassed that after so long I would ask something so silly. I have just been reading about imposter syndrome and kind of felt like maybe I am better than I think but I just have imposter syndrome or something but now I'm just feeling like damn maybe i really don't have the grasp on this i think i do, but when i look at the time spent over the years I'm just like WTF. There's people who go 6 months programming from absolute beginner and find a job and are seemingly better than I am.\n\nReally and honestly is this a question I should feel stupid for asking for the amount of time I have been coding for? I seem to have this really strange phenomenon where I have done some advanced programming stuff yet maybe haven't got a grasp on some basic things (it seems).

Instead of a 1-yr plan, maybe expand it to 2-yrs given layoffs, firings, hiring freezes, increased competition, etc. That said, some places are still hiring, so it isn't total gloom-and-doom. Example of how it took a person 1,000 job apps to get a job (with a degree): [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/yybzty/new_gradearly_career_international_never_give_up/)\n\n**Bootcamp warning**: some jump into a bootcamp for 3-6mo and manage to graduate. With prep beforehand this'll improve your chances and experience. I know some who got a job within a month of grad from a bootcamp (diff. yr &amp; economy timing) whereas others are still looking after almost 1yr. Or some who've been laid off and back into job searching.\n\n**Roadmap resources**: [1](https://roadmap.sh/), [2](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap)\n\n**Self-taught / bootcamp to job example timelines** (note diff. entry yrs &amp; economy): [1](https://jenniferdewalt.com/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/yshl4i/comment/iw0cygz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), [3](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/inspirational-success-stories-from-self-taught-web-developers-4f6f375cf17d/)\n\nUnsure about the market for older coders but at the large company I work at, there's people in their mid-30s to late 40s like yourself upskilling and aiming to internally transfer into junior dev roles, which the company seems to be receptive of based on their yrs of loyalty, good performance reviews, output productivity history, etc. So while ageism may be an underlying note in all jobs and industries to some level perhaps, it doesn't appear to be all doom-and-gloom either since talent, productivity, and retention is the sought-after thing here.\n\n**Main advice imo**: focus on skill building and deep understanding through building projects and in time gain 3 impressive polished ones to put on resume and personal website for job applications.

Do people just know the best methods of design? Or is it more that multiple structures could work, and it just comes down to picking your favorite?\n\nNow I'm not talking about the basics like Polymorphism, Inheritance, etc. but rather the choices of one option over another when there are multiple ways you could implement something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MY EXAMPLE:**\n\nI am trying to build a program that simulates a fight in a shooter videogame. A rough idea of the class structure would be:\n\n    //A basic clock that keeps track of the damages done and when they occured\n    class TimeLine\n        event Tick\n        float _interval\n        float _currentTime\n        (An undecided structure to hold the result damages, their times, and other data)\n    \n    //The classes of the different characters as each one might have different stats, weapons, abilities, etc\n    abstract class Character\n        Stats baseStats\n        \n        class Character1\n            Weapon weapon\n            Ability ability1\n            Ability ability2\n            ...\n    \n    //The classes for the different kinds of weapons characters might have\n    abstract class Weapon\n        class gun\n        ...\n    \n    //The class for the different abilities characters might have\n    abstract class Ability\n        class ability1\n        ...\n\nThe main struggles I have are with the best way to handle \"Has-A\" relationships and Events.\n\n**HAS-A:**\n\nIn my design, different characters could have different numbers of weapons/abilities or other stuff down the line. Is it better/worse/not important to have each Character class have the exact variables, or to do something where the parent class of Character has a List&lt;Weapon&gt;, List&lt;Ability&gt;...\n\n**EVENTS:**\n\nMy events question is initially tied to the \"Tick\" event I have in the TimeLine class which is essentially causing updates for all the objects for values such as CurrentCooldown or ReloadTime.\n\nI see the options as:\n\n1. Have every character, weapon, &amp; ability class have a reference to the timeline, and subscription to the \"Tick\" event, and a method that updates on tick.\n2. Have the Character have a reference to the timeline, and then call update methods in all weapons and abilities that it has.\n3. Don't use events and have an update method in the character called by the timeline, and that update method calls the weapons and ability's update methods.\n\nAs I type this, I am also wondering if events are meant for a more dynamic situation, where the weapons, abilities, and such aren't as pre-defined as my project has them.\n\n**STRUCTURE IN GENERAL:**\n\nAdditionally, there are a couple of questions about the structure in general.\n\n1. How much is too much abstraction? I could, in the gun class, have an Ammo component that handles the tracking of ammo, max ammo, etc. Or I could just have 3 int values of current, max, and bonus (for whatever else) with updates handled in the shoot method by a current--.\n2. If I am not having the variables for Weapons, Abilities, etc put in the Character1, Character2, etc classes, but instead have a List&lt;Weapon&gt;, List&lt;Ability&gt;, etc. Then is it better to not even have the Character# classes, and instead handle them as constructors? Like:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n    // THIS STRUCTURE\n    \n    abstract class Character {\n        Stats baseStats //has HP, movespeed, etc\n    }\n    \n    class Character1 extends Character {\n        Weapon weapon\n        Ability ability1\n        Ability ability2\n    }\n    \n    // VS\n    \n    class Character {\n        Stats baseStats\n        List&lt;Weapon&gt; weapons\n        List&lt;Ability&gt; abilities\n        public Character(Stats, List&lt;Weapon&gt;, List&lt;Ability) {\n            this.baseStats = Stats;\n            ...\n        }\n    }\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNOTES:\n\n* My main language is C#\n* If I need to explain anything else on my thought process, please let me know","score":3,"comments":[{"body":"The general issue here is that you're trying to solve the entire program at once.

You might not use it often, depending on what you're working on, but just throwing your hands in the air because you have a notion that it may not be your thing is not what you want to settle for.\n\nRecursion is:\n\n* Not very different from normal function calls at all. Learn how the [call stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack) works. Function definitions are sort of blueprints for execution - sort of like classes vs. objects. The actual stack frames on the call stack are like the \"objects\" in that analogy. Recursion is more special conceptually than it is mechanically under the hood.\n* Recursion usually carries out some kind of \"delegation\". For example, many recursive solutions (not all, but many) take off one small piece of the problem, and then hand off the entire rest of the problem to another recursive call. Only when that recursive call finishes can you combine the results into a final answer, and so on up back up the chain to the original/root call. Every time you call deeper and deeper, you're just piling stack frames onto the call stack, waiting for the subordinate call to finish its work.  The subordinate call with the easiest workload is the one that hits the base cases - it has no more work to delegate, so it's able to immediately give back its own answer without any further calls.\n\nKeyword here is stack.  Think of a literal stack.  What happens when you put things on a stack? You can't get the things on bottom until you pop things off the top. First in first out (FIFO).\n\nThe call stack works in tandem with the program counter. The program counter is very dumb, it just points to the next instruction. The call stack is a way of restoring variables/data from different function calls previously captured on the call stack, as well as return addresses for the program counter to jump back to.","score":1,"comments":[]},{"body":"","score":0,"comments":[]}]},{"title":"Japanese ‚áî code review &amp; advice","not_safe_for_work":false,"locked":false,"body":"Hi, I'm a sophomore at a Japanese university and study programming by myself. \nHaving no mentor or personal coach, I want someone who offers me to review my project. \nIn return for the kind help, I can teach Japanese.

That's probably at the level to aim for.  Write the code as if it were, say, Python, then just write it in English.\n\nI think pseudocode makes much more sense as you gain more experience.\n\nI was listening to a talk maybe 15 years ago.  Although I was at a technical conference, it was about being a novice vs. being an expert.  Novices need very explicit instructions as they know nothing and want to be reassured that they didn't miss any steps.  Experts, on the other hand, don't need every detail spelled out for them.  They can leave out lots of details and other experts will understand.\n\nMy suggestion is to use Google.  Search for \"how to write pseudocode\".  Or look for some YouTube videos.

Should I denormalize?\n\nI'm learning event sourcing now, and I'm having trouble knowing where (or if) i should normalize my data.\n\n### As far as I know, this are the core concepts:\n\n* Event sourcing is a pattern that consists of storing entities (or something similiar) as a timeline of events.\n* Projections process events to construct a state until certain point in time.\n* Snapshots are stored states of projections.\n\n### Implementation details:\n\n* I'm using MySQL as an event store.\n* I'm using Redis as a snapshot store.\n* Projections are objects that connects to both stores. They get the latest snapshot and process the new events, updating it's current state.\n* Strongly consistent, because I'm querying the event store directly.\n\n### Entity modeling\n\n* Users can have many teams.\n* Teams can have many users.\n\n### Problem\n\nI need to aggregate the events in this format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"name\": \"Lorem\",\n  \"team\": {\n  \t\"id\": 2,\n  \t\"name\": \"ipsun\",\n  \t\"description\": \"dolor sit\",\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Solution 1\n\nMy first tought is to make the projection consume, not only the user related event, but also all teams related events. That way I can keep the current state of the teams and, when necessary, \"join\" the user with the team it's refering to.\n\nThe major drawback that I can think of is the large amount of space the storing of these snapshots will consume. If a have 'S' snapshots per user, 'U' number of users and 'T' amount of teams, the number of duplicated data I will have is approximately: S * U * T\n\n### Solution 2\n\nMy second thought is to make two projection: one for the user, one for the team, and them \"join\" then later.\nThe problem I see with this solution is the need for two database/cache trips. One for the team, other for the user, and because I depend on the information of one to start with the other, they can not be done asynchronously.","score":1,"comments":[]},{"title":"Does imposter syndrome affects many people who are in programming?","not_safe_for_work":false,"locked":false,"body":"Same as title.","score":865,"comments":[{"body":"I've been slinging code for almost 13 years and I question myself regularly.

If you miss your self-given deadlines, take notes about why and what went wrong.\n\nPracticing this kind of self-discipline will trick your brain in to expecting smaller/simpler goals, rather than being overwhelmed by the grand picture.

So if length is 10, you actually want to stop counting at 9.\n* In Ruby, \"..\" means a range \"including the last element\" and \"...\" means \"a range excluding the last element.\"\n\nPutting them together, if you want a range that starts at the first elememnt and goes to the last element of a sequence, you might use 0...sequence.length.\n\nOne thing worth warning you about with Ruby programmers, if you haven't noticed already, is that they tend to get into functional programming and code golf a little more heavily than is probably healthy, so there's a good chance when you go looking for example answers for problems like that, you'll probably see some nonsense like `sequence.each_cons(2).map{|a, b| a &lt; b }.all?`, which is fun and all, but it's really hard to read when you're learning, so don't worry if you run into that sort of mess and feel dumb.","score":2,"comments":[{"body":"you're right.
