Not even his business partners knew that he no longer personally owned any part of DFS.¬†For years, Atlantic gave away money in secret, requiring recipients to not reveal the sources of their donations. \"Beyond Mr. Feeney's reticence about blowing his own horn, 'it was also a way to leverage more donations‚Äîsome other individual might contribute to get the naming rights.'\"¬†The largest single beneficiary of Feeney's giving is his alma mater¬†Cornell University, which has received nearly $1 billion in direct and Atlantic gifts, including a donation of $350 million enabling the creation of Cornell's¬†New York City Tech Campus¬†on Roosevelt Island.\nThrough Atlantic, he has also donated around one billion dollars to education in Ireland, mostly to¬†third-level institutions¬†such as the¬†University of Limerick¬†and¬†Dublin City University. Feeney has given substantial personal donations to¬†Sinn F√©in, a left-wing Irish nationalist party that is historically associated with the¬†IRA. He has also supported the modernization of public-health structures in Vietnam.\n\nIn February 2011, Feeney became a signatory to¬†The Giving Pledge.¬†In his letter to¬†Bill Gates¬†and¬†Warren Buffett, the founders of The Giving Pledge, Feeney writes, \"I cannot think of a more personally rewarding and appropriate use of wealth than to give while one is living‚Äîto personally devote oneself to meaningful efforts to improve the human condition. More importantly, today's needs are so great and varied that intelligent philanthropic support and positive interventions can have greater value and impact today than if they are delayed when the needs are greater.\"¬†He gave away his last $7 million in late 2016, to the same recipient of his first charitable donations: Cornell. Over the course of his life, he has given away more than $8 billion. At its height, Atlantic had over 300 employees and 10 offices across the globe.\n\nIn July 2017, The Atlantic Philanthropies noted the existence of an¬†advance-fee scam¬†email claiming to distribute money to \"randomly selected individuals\" worldwide, and using a link to the Wikipedia article to falsely verify the scammer's identity as \"Charles Feeney\".\n\nOn September 14, 2020, Feeney closed down the Atlantic Philanthropies after the nonprofit accomplished its mission of giving away all of Feeney's money by 2020.\n\n\n~ Wikipedia, Philanthropy","score":52,"comments":[]},{"body":"I have to break down a large amount such as $1Billion into something easier for me to picture.
