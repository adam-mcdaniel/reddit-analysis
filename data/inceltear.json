{"name":"inceltear","description":"IncelTear is a subreddit for posting screenshots of hateful, misogynist, racist, violent, and often bizarre content created by hateful ‚Äúincels\" (involuntary celibates). We do not condone blanket hatred of virgins or the romantically unsuccessful. Blackpilled incels blame women, their genes, attractive men, and society at large for their inability to get dates or sex. Occasional meta discussion is also welcome. This is not a sub about k!lling incels","subscribers":114346,"posts":[{"title":"Weekly Advice Thread (November 28, 2022)","not_safe_for_work":false,"locked":false,"body":"There's  no strict limit over what types of advice can be sought; it can pertain  to general anxiety over virginity, specific romantic situations, or  concern that you're drifting toward misogynistic/\"blackpill\" lines of thought. Please go to [r/SuicideWatch](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/)  for matters pertaining to suicidal ideation, as we simply can't  guarantee that the people here will have sufficient resources to tackle  such issues.\n\nAs for rules  pertaining to the advice givers: all of the sub-wide rules are still in  place, but these posts will also place emphasis on avoiding what is  often deemed \"normie platitudes.\" Essentially, it's something of a  nebulous categorization that will ultimately come down to mod  discretion, but it should be easy to understand. Simply put, aim for  specific and personalized advice. Don't say \"take a shower\" unless  someone literally says that they don't shower. Ask \"what kind of  exercise do you do?\" instead of just saying \"Go to the gym, bro!\"\n\nFurthermore,  top-level responses should only be from people seeking advice. Don't  just post what you think romantically unsuccessful people, in general,  should do. Again, we're going for specific and personalized advice.\n\nThese  threads are not a substitute for professional help. Other's insights  may be helpful, but keep in mind that they are not a licensed therapist  and do not actually know you. Posts containing obvious trolling or  harmful advice will be removed.

The odds are massively against you with sites like Tinder, because the ratio of men to women is at least 3:1. Plus those sites tend to be incredibly shallow.
