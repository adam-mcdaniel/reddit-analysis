Thanks to user att3e3a for adding that exams can be done (and evidence collected) up to 72 hours after the assault, and even if you‚Äôve eaten/showered/etc, evidence can still be collected. Also, STI/pregnancy prevention may still be available after 72 hours. \n\n‚ÄîIf the assault involved your mouth, don‚Äôt eat or drink anything. \nDon‚Äôt shower or use the restroom if possible (if you have to pee, drip dry a bit and then put your underwear back on). \n‚ÄîIf there‚Äôs a chance you were able to scratch your attacker, don‚Äôt wash your hands (DNA may be under your nails). \n‚ÄîDon‚Äôt change clothes if possible (if you do, bring the original clothes you were assaulted in to the ER- per comments, in a paper bag or pillow case to preserve evidence, not a plastic bag). Clothing may be taken as evidence with your consent, you may not get it back. \n‚ÄîIf you‚Äôre on your period, bring any pads/tampons from during/after the assault to the ER. \n\n\nThis is all stuff I‚Äôve learned working with SANEs (Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners) and survivors that I wish was common knowledge.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the awards!! Also thank you to everyone sharing more advice! As a disclaimer, I work in Texas so some (all?) if this may differ based on state/country. Hopefully at least some of it translates to where you are or you now know to look into your area‚Äôs options/resources. Most(?) areas have sexual assault advocacy groups/centers that can help survivors with many assault-related things, so it may be a good idea to be familiar with them in case you or someone you know needs help in the future. \n\nMore Texas specific info: the SA exam (with or without evidence collection - swabs/photos/etc) is covered by the state, but STI/pregnancy prevention is run through health insurance and may not be completely covered. Survivors can apply for Crime Victims Compensation to get reimbursed for the rest ONLY IF they report the assault to law enforcement. If you are a minor and present to the ED for SA, it is considered a mandatory report for the hospital, BUT you do not have to consent to evidence collection and you do NOT have to participate in the investigation. If you want to have evidence collected, but aren‚Äôt sure you want to report, they will collect it and store it and you have up to 5 years to choose to report. Once reported, cases can take years, or sometimes decades, to be heard in court. Not all reported sexual assaults are go to court.","score":12353,"comments":[{"body":"Hello and welcome to r/LifeProTips!\n\nPlease help us decide if this post is a good fit for the subreddit by up or downvoting this comment. \n\nIf you think that this is great advice to improve your life, please upvote.

You can also use a speaker or your phone. (iPhone has this built in). The trick is to have it slightly below your tinnitus ‚Äúlevel‚Äù. This is called masking. Eventually - if lucky your brain will start tuning out the tinnitus a bit. \n\n2) it‚Äôs common to get a fight or flight response when getting Tinnitus. This can actually make your tinnitus ‚Äúlouder‚Äù, as you start to focus on it. It‚Äôs important to know that it‚Äôs not your ears, it‚Äôs your brain making the sound. \n\n3) protect your hearing from further damage. Always wear hearing protection at concerts, clubs or other loud places. Use noise cancelling headphones  so you can keep your volume at a safe level. \n\n4) get enough sleep, eat as healthy as you can, and try not to stress too much. This can affect your Tinnitus. \n\n5) this is the hardest part and it will take time, but accept that you have it. It‚Äôs part of your life now and when you eventually accept it, you will stop listening for it. \n\nNote: Tinnitus is very individual, people have it worse than others.

Instead, start by looking for the type of thing you think you‚Äôd like to do; using existing job ads can help with that.\n\nThen, start applying for every job out there, at your pace.  Go to any interviews you get not thinking you may or my not get the job, but to learn how interviews work.  Talk to the interviewers, be honest with them about your experience and your situation, and ask them to give you some honest feedback about their impressions of you when they ask if you have questions at the end.\n\nThe next bit is important: that feedback isn‚Äôt about you, it‚Äôs about how they see you in that context.  Use it to see how you can improve and also to see what sort of people are in management positions.  Don‚Äôt agree to work for someone who stresses you out in the interview; it won‚Äôt get any better afterwards.\n\nAfter the interviews, be honest about whether you would actually consider the position.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think this would be a good fit for me, I‚Äôm looking for something more like X‚Äù is perfectly fine to tell them.  Then who knows?  If you find an interviewer that you mesh well with but the open position isn‚Äôt what you actually want, tell them what you do want, and they‚Äôll think of you if such a position opens up.\n\nI‚Äôve even been on interviews where I researched the org and the department beforehand, and went in telling them why I was interested in the department and what I thought I could bring to the team‚Ä¶ they then scrapped the open position and wrote up a new one based on what I had suggested, mapping the requirements to my CV.  So I ended up being the perfect candidate for the job.\n\nInterestingly, I didn‚Äôt end up taking that job because I got an offer from a different company where I had a much better social fit and they had better work/life balance.  I kept in touch though, and let the hiring manager know why I took a different offer.\n\nTL;DR: use job searches as no-strings learning opportunities, not a make or break ‚Äúget yourself hired at all cost‚Äù.

Is this thing actually going to be useful to you, and where are you going to keep it so that it is accessible and useable? Items often end up getting thrown out because they were an impulse buy that was interesting but not actually useful, or because they went into the bottom of a drawer and then never used for years. Not making those purchases in the first place would mean you throw out fewer things.\n\nIn the kitchen, put a pen and a piece of paper next to your bin. Every time you throw something in the bin, make a note of what it was. After a week, go through your list, and see what patterns you notice. If you are throwing away a lot of food that has gone bad, then maybe you need to change your habits about purchasing or storage, or maybe you just need to be more disciplined about using things in a timely fashion. If you are throwing out a lot of juice cartons or crisp packets or suchlike, then maybe you could be eating and drinking things that don't come in single-use wrappings or containers, maybe making a sandwich or a glass of water or a cup of tea would be less wasteful.\n\nHow much are you recycling as opposed to throwing in the bin? If you habitually take the paper spam that comes through your letter box and put it in the bin instead of putting it to the paper recycling, then that is an easy change to make. Similarly, if you throw away glass bottles or jars instead of giving them a rinse and putting them to glass recycling, that is another easy change. \n\nIf you can be more prepared and more organised in general, then you will need to buy (and then throw out) fewer things that tend to need to be bought when you find yourself disorganised or unprepared. You mention carrying reusable bags instead of plastic bags, that's great! Other things might involve carrying a reusable water bottle in your backpack when you go out, instead of buying something to drink and throwing away the bottle. or having plastic tubs in your kitchen for storing things in the fridge or freezer rather than single use plastic bags.

And under braking a motorcycle is basically balanced on its front tire with almost zero traction from the back. Lots of physics involved but if you brake check a motorcycle, there is a very good chance you end up killing someone. On top of that, when someone is braking hard at high speed on a motorcycle they are having to do way more than what people who have never been on a motorcycle really understand. \n\nEven on a bike that has ABS like mine does, the rear of the bike lifts under heavy braking and you not only have to control the front of your bike where you use basically all of your upper body strength, but you are also having to balance and use an insane amount of core muscles and your thighs to balance out the rear of the bike since under heavy braking its trying to escape from under your ass the whole time. That's not including, clutch control, engine braking which ruins the motorcycle, shifting, and throttle control so my bike doesn't die and lock up and send me flying. Lots of shit. \n\nThis isn't even the most important part though. Lots of states have motorcycle safety and training classes. These teach a rider what they can and can't fo on the road. Know your state laws but MOTORCYCLES HAVE DIFFRENT LAWS THAN CARS. A lot of people get absolutely pissed when motorcycles pass them at super fast speeds, lane split (in California but that needs to be the entire US), go through red lights, swerve around when you are turning in a car amongst a lot of other things.\n\nLet me explain. Some states, including mine, you are allowed on a motorcycle to go far over the speed limit to pass Cars. It's not because we think you are slow usually (it gets taken advantage of), it's because it is dead ass safer for us to not be sandwiched or in blind spots. In my state we can go on red lights if it's safe to do so as well. It is more dangerous to sit at a light and get rear ended than to go through a red. Lane splitting is also safer for the person on the motorcycle for many of the same reasons and it also makes sure the bikes don't either overheat or die in the middle of the road.\n\nNow for the braking. Motorcycle classes, tell us to specifically GO AROUND and not to try and out brake people since we can't do it. In a car you are supposed to be defensive and then brake. We are taught to KEEP SPEED AND GTFO THE WAY since we can't brake as fast, but because we are way more maneuverable. Braking while doing any maneuver is basically a death sentence at highway speeds and a very large ER bill that includes a lot of surgery at even 30mph. So we don't brake. Sometimes we go faster. And we are not only allowed to to it, but it's incouraged. \n\nSo don't cut off motorcycles if you feel like you where slighted by them for whatever reason and don't freak out when we do shit that looks or seems illegal. Know your states laws but a lot of times people on motorcycles have a very very different set of rules than cars. It's not to piss you off, it's litterally taught because it's safer than doing what cars do.","score":0,"comments":[{"body":"Hello and welcome to r/LifeProTips!\n\nPlease help us decide if this post is a good fit for the subreddit by up or downvoting this comment. \n\nIf you think that this is great advice to improve your life, please upvote.

Last place I worked (in the Accounting Dept) my boss had a catered company Christmas luncheon for us. There were new people in the department, so she had everyone go around the table and introduce and say something about themselves. EVERYONE (about 12 employees) mentioned that they had been there for less than two years, with the exception of one person. That should have been our clue to get the hell out of dodge, but no one picked up on it. We've all moved on now, but she is still with the company.
