Both of which are totally at odds with Xi's desire to portray no respect for Hong Kong democracy or the handover agreements.\n\nBut either way, he wanted to take over the messaging/headline that he could foresee from the journalist. And rather than not answer, he goes on the offensive in such a peculiar way.
