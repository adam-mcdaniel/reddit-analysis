I AM AN A&amp;P. I AM LICENSED AND ALLOWED TO WORK ON AIRCRAFT.  EVEN LICENSED MECHANICS MAKE MISTAKES. THIS STORY IS ABOUT A LICENSED MECHANIC MAKING A MISTAKE, IF YOU HAVE AN ISSUE WITH IT TAKE IT UP WITH MURPHY\n\n\n&gt;”Zee here.”\r\n\r\n&gt;**New Owner** “I think the battery is done for.  I had trouble starting it this morning, and then I had to get a jump to taxi back from the gas pumps.”\r\n\r\n&gt;**Zee** “Thanks for letting me know.  I’ll get a new one ordered up.”\n\nDespite the regular maintenance performed by the shop annually, owning this plane was turning out to be more work for me than I expected.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nAfter getting my pilot’s license in 2020, I’d been dreaming of my own airplane.  I’d scan ads and postings all the time, looking for a good deal that would work for me, but I wasn’t having any luck.  Then one day in the spring of 2021, a post appeared on everyone’s favorite “Is this real, or is it a scam and I’m going to get murdered in an alleyway somewhere” classified board of the interwebsnets.  \r\n\r\nFor sale, a 1/6th share of a 1973 Cessna 177RG Cardinal.  Go look it up, it’s a beautiful plane.  Don’t worry, I’ll wait.  It’s the best looking high-wing you’re going to find and was only a ‘failure’ in replacing the 172 because Cessna’s leadership made a series of stupid decisions that led to the first year’s production run being underpowered and a minor engineering issue with a tendency to have the tail stall and the nose suddenly plunging to the runway at the typical speeds of the landing flare. \r\n\r\nThe RG, however, fixed all of that. Special slots had been added to the design of the stabilator (the horizontal surface at the tail) to prevent the stall, a constant-speed propeller and a 200 horsepower engine replaced the anemic fixed-pitch 150 HP engine, and by the time of the production of this particular model of the 177RG, they were given 60 gallon extended range tanks.  The RG means retractable gear, which means this strutless plane has the clean profile to accompany the power and range of the changes and has become a beloved niche airplane.\r\n\r\nSomehow, I got my wife to go see it, and then after flying in it, managed to convince her that we should buy into it.  Fifteen large simoleans later, I had a signed contract as a new member of the ownership LLC and a mandate from the group’s insurance company to get 30 hours of dual time with an *approved* instructor before I’m allowed to fly this plane on my own, since I had no complex rating or experience at the time.  No big deal, should only take a couple months at most.\r\n\r\nAs of today, I’m still needing 3.7 hours.  Not as easy as I had expected.  \r\n\r\nBeing an A&amp;P, I was thrilled to begin to take on some of the maintenance tasks, if needed. Unfortunately, the plane would need what is called an “Annual Inspection” every year (funny how that’s named) to ensure it is airworthy and doesn’t need any additional maintenance.  This inspection has to be conducted by an A&amp;P with an Inspection Authorization, something I don’t have, nor do I have the time for.  Essentially, an IA is a mechanic who has a library of knowledge of the aircraft they are working on, has taken a written and oral examination, and attends a certain number of hours of continuing education events and trainings every year to maintain currency.  \r\n\r\nAn Annual Inspection, performed by the IA, is a deep dive into the conditions of the aircraft and is a perfect opportunity to find all sorts of things wrong with a plane, much like the letter checks we use at the airlines for the big birds.  It is easily one of the more expensive recurring expenses to owning a plane, so long as you don’t ever think about the engine.  This year, for example, our (very old) exhaust system was falling apart and needed replacement.  It wasn’t cheap, though split six ways it was much more bearable than if it had been out of my pocket alone.  Of course, the other problem with an annual is scheduling—you need to get on the shop’s schedule early, or else you’re going to have a hard time getting in.  \r\n\r\nThanks to Covid, the gift that just keeps on giving in all sorts of new and horrible ways, $Airline has been poaching every single mechanic that had a pulse and wasn’t on the Naughty List already, which means that the local General Aviation shops have been getting emptied of talent.  This has meant I’ve been digging more into the incidental maintenance, thus the call from our newest owner in the group about two weeks ago. \r\n\r\nWe knew the battery was dying, but it had limped along so far, and had to have passed the load tests (it didn’t) that were supposed to have been performed every year (they weren’t).  I also figured it was getting it’s fluids topped off every year as well.  (It wasn’t.)  We let it continue doing its thing, but now we had no choice.   It was time.\r\n\r\nFirst thing I do, of course, is look in the parts manual for what part number battery it requires.  A bit of digging, and I find I can get a good old reliable Flooded Cell Battery from Textron, the company which owns Cessna, for a mere 300 bucks.  Another search of AirplaneFir, an aviation supply website, showed it for a noticeable chunk more.  On the other hand, I saw for a bit more than that we could upgrade to the fancy Sealed Lead Acid Battery (SLAB), which would remove the need for venting and other maintenance, and likely get something that’ll last another five years.  Unfortunately, while the standard 177 A &amp; B models could just accept a new SLAB without any fancy paperwork, the *177RG* required a Supplemental Type Certificate, that is, a license with conversion instructions (to really, really simplify it), to install and *different model and part number battery.*  I knew we didn’t have the STC on the plane, so I presented that as part of the costs to the guys for replacement.  I would also need to enlist the help of an IA I knew to submit the FAA Form 337, as this would be a Major Alteration (because of the STC) and only an IA can submit that.\r\n\r\nAfter a week of waiting to hear back from everyone, I went and ordered up the new SLAB at the advice of my IA associate and called up the owner of the STC to register and purchase, verified that we didn’t already own a license to it, and then emailed everyone to let them know I went with the SLAB.  One of the guys responded almost immediately, irate about not having a vote on the change and asking if I’d actually gone and *looked* at the battery.\r\n\r\nI hadn’t and immediately made the 30 minute drive to the hangar to check it out.  Naturally I didn’t reply to his email right away while I went to perform the inspection I *should* have performed that first day.  And when I got to the airport, removed the aft wall off the cargo area and pulled the cover off the battery box, I started swearing.\r\n\r\nInstead of being greeted by a half dozen cell caps and a vent tube, instead I saw a pink battery with no caps at all.  Specifically, a Sealed Lead Acid Battery of the part number used only by the 177 A &amp; B and not at all effective to the 177RG.  They’d even gone so far as to remove the vent tube as required by the STC conversion, but beyond that, no paperwork had been done.  \r\n\r\nWhen I’d explained exactly what I found to my fellow owners, there was no issue at all to my changing over to the SLAB and buying the STC.\r\n\r\nAbout a week later, the battery and paperwork arrived and I went over to the airport and performed the change.  And that, my dear friends, is where I stepped in it.\r\n\r\nThe funny thing about batteries is that there’s a particular order to how you remove and install the cables and terminals.  You always remove the negative first and then the positive when removing the battery, then install the positive followed by the negative last when installing.  There’s a warning in the manual, it’s how you do things in cars, it is *standard practice.*  Only an absolute muppet could mess that up.\r\n\r\nAnd so naturally as I install the battery I suddenly lose control of my faculties and proceed to hook up the *negative* terminal first, followed by the positive.  And as my socket is tightening that last contact, my wrench slips and \r\n\r\n###KRAKOWW!!\r\n\r\nThankfully I’d at least taken the precaution of wearing gloves and didn’t feel the juice myself.  But the poor aluminum skin of the airplane did.  And boy, did it feel it.  The back of my socket wrench was singed, but the skin of the plane was now sporting a ragged 1/8” hole where I’d contacted.  I checked to make sure there was no other damage, made sure the battery wasn’t ruined now, and verified all the instruments in the plane still worked.  Amazingly, I hadn’t fried anything.  \r\n\r\nI called up a friend with a hangar across the airfield and asked if I could borrow his sheetmetal tools and he gave me his door code.  It took about five trips to get everything I needed (I gathered everything right away, but kept forgetting things in the other hangar), just as any home project requires multiple trips to the hardware store and eventually managed to drill out the hole and install a 3/16” rivet in a standard repair.\r\n\r\nWhat had been a ten minute job had turned into almost two hours of driving between hangars.  You’d think I’d be smarter than that.\r\n\r\nBut hey, the plane flies now, so I can’t complain too much, right?\n\n\nEdit: because there's been a stink raised in the comments about me being \"unlicensed\" and \"inexperienced\", let me assure you that I am actually licensed, and experience doesn't stop stupid from happening.  \n\nAs far as the accusation of an illegal repair, at that point you can talk to my lawyer and IAs.\n\n\n*Enjoy what you've read?

When I got back  from my vacation I brought this to the owners of the company and that person was never allowed to call me again without authorization from management since I charged them quite a bit for a phone call that amounted to \"wait for the power to turn back on\".","score":6,"comments":[]},{"body":"","score":0,"comments":[]}]},{"title":"Why go to IT, when you can just whip out your company credit card? Or tell me your problem, instead of coming up with your own solution.","not_safe_for_work":false,"locked":false,"body":"I think everyone that works in IT has had at least one encounter where a user comes rolls up with a solution instead of a problem.  I had such an encounter a few months ago.\n\nOne of our departments had a new joiner and they needed a piece of software installed on the joiner's computer.  We looked through our software catalogue, but couldn't find it.  But, when we checked our inventory tool, we found that everyone in their department had it installed.  I put it down to poor documentation, downloaded an installer, installed the program, confirmed it ran, and left it at that.\n\nA few days later, I'm asked what the license key is.  Bugger.  I look through our shared mailbox and cannot find any references to this product or vendor.  I check our licenses folder and turn up nothing.  I check with the team making the request to find out when previous licenses were purchased, check it against the department's budget for the periods when the licenses had been bought in the past, and discover we never purchased the licenses.\n\nAfter some more digging, I find out that the license cost is CHF 125 per user, they've been purchased on the old manager's company credit card, the new manager does not have a company credit card, the current licenses they have are for an older version of the application, they previously licensed a user that no longer works for the company, their old license cannot be transferred to the current version, and we cannot find an installer for the version they currently have.  I reach out to the vendor's support for an old installer and, as expected, they told us to upgrade.\n\nSome arguments ensue as to who should be responsible for buying the new license.  I say it shouldn't be us, my manager concurs, their manager doens't want the cost on their cost centre, and this new joiner is sat there twiddling their thumbs one day a week because they need this software to complete their tasks.\n\nSo I take a step back and figure out what this program acutally does and what it is used for.\n\nIt actually seems like a pretty cool application.  You enter a path, enter some keywords or serach terms, apply some filters (create date, last modified, file type, etc.), and it will return all files that staisfy those terms, identifying duplicates, highlighting the similarities or differences between files, etc.  I ran it on our department's contracts folder and was able to find the invoice for a storage array we had purchased seven years prior, but hadn't been able to find the invoice for, which was preventing us from selling it to a reseller.\n\nBut why did they need the program?\n\nEvery day, a series of reports come in from various locations.  These reports are dumped into a single folder.  The file names are randomly generated.  Sometimes, 2 or 3 reports can come in between them checking the folder, but they only need the latest report.  Sometimes reports are accidentally sent with no data in them, so these need to be discarded.  They periodically need to find the latest report for a specific location and then email it to another team in another country.  Different people on the team are responsible for different locations, hence why all the team need this program.\n\nSo the team will open the program, enter the path of the folder containing all the reports, search for the location code, and then click 'go'.  They then drag the latest report into the folder for that location and send an email to the team based in another country.\n\nIt took about 5 minutes to understand the above process.\n\nI took a look into the contents of the report and saw that it's basically a CSV with a strange file extension.  The first row is a header, containing the names for each column.  The third column is the location code, which always follows one of the same formats:\n\n    [number][letter][number][number]\n    [number][letter][letter][number]\n    [number][letter][letter][letter]\n    [number][letter][number][letter]\n\nWithin 15 minutes, I've written and tested a PowerShell script that will scan through all the files in the folder, use regex on the second line to extract the location code, copy the file to a new folder renaming it to the location code and the date the report was generated (plus an auto-incrementing number on the end if there are more than one from the same day), and then adding the original file name to a text file to prevent the script from checking the same file twice.\n\nThe script was placed on a task server and scheduled to run every 15 minutes.\n\nThis meant the team could now go into this new folder, use Windows Search to find the location code, and then read the date in the file name to identify the latest report.  It took about 5 minutes to train the team on the new process.  And then, upon realising that the team they forward these reports to could perform the task just as easily, it took another 5 minutes to change the path the renamed reports are saved to, and train the second team on their new process.\n\nThey'd been using this process for around five years.  It took them around 3 hours a week to complete.  They'd purchased four licenses for the tool so far at around CHF 125 per license.  Estimating their hourly rate at CHF 30, their cost to date for completing this task would have been:\n\n    30 x 3 x 52 x 5 = 23,400\n            125 x 4 =    500\n                      ------\n                      23,900 CHF\n                     ~24,200 EUR\n                     ~25,040 USD\n\nObviously, inflation, exchange rates, discount rate, etc. would alter this figure.  But my hourly rate is around CHF 41 an hour.  I spent probably an hour trying to implement their solution, 5 minutes understanding their problem, and 25 minutes implementing and training them on my solution, a solution that eliminated one team's need to do any work at all on this particular task.  That's 90 minutes, costing CHF 61.50.\n\nCHF 23,900.  CHF 61.50.  Do the maths.\n\nIn short, when you have a problem, come to IT, don't try to figure it out yourself.","score":1961,"comments":[{"body":"This is the kind of laziness I appreciate in a tech. \"I'm so lazy I will spend 10 hours figuring out how to complete a 5 minute daily process in 10 seconds, and another 10 hours to eliminate it entirely.\"","score":426,"comments":[{"body":"Tech is full of lazy people who sprint near the deadline\n\nSource: me I am that person","score":204,"comments":[{"body":"There's also lazy people who sprint for hours, give up and realize there was a much easier solution.","score":91,"comments":[{"body":"Why you targeting me bro","score":70,"comments":[]},{"body":"","score":0,"comments":[]}]},{"body":"","score":0,"comments":[]}]},{"body":"","score":0,"comments":[]}]},{"body":"I accidently eliminated two teams of people by asking questions.

Long story short, I flaked to their manager and found out they were printing these and giving them to another team that scanned them back in.

You have broken into the office and are stealing customers info...\"\n\nI cut the call mid sentence, I look at my Juniors who are both staring at me and say \"I am not paid enough to deal with that...\"\n\nCustomer proceeded to call over and over but I spent the next 2 hours dropping her call every time I saw it in the call queue.\n\nLet my boss know to check the call recordings, I get a laughing emoji in response.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6 Days later I find 16 customer service complaints logged against me that no-one in management or Customer service team told me about.\n\nListen to the Voicemails attached to tickets.\n\n\"Hello??? There is someone in your office stealing peoples information, I am worried about your staffs safety. He kept asking me for my information and when I asked him why he needed this information he told me it is because it is what I want and when I asked him if he truly works for \\[Company name\\] he said no he doesn't and told me to F#$% Off....

We were looking to move to VOIP from an OLD and i mean old PBX system. I had some VOIP experience so guess who they asked from IT to get this started. Easy guess , me.\n\n  \nWe went through a few vendors and a few demos and after a couple of months and a little coaxing we went with the Cisco solution. Fast forward we implement the solution and after a few late nights and long days all is well. I maintain the system on the network side and since i have previous experience with VOIP i learn as much as i can when comes to CUCM and UCCX (Keep UCCX in mind). Over years i take various training classes and overall be become pretty proficient in all things CUCM and UCCX. I also develop some pretty good contacts that i can lean on within Cisco for help with anything i may need some some assistance on. Keep in mind these contacts are outside of Cisco TAC.\n\n  \nFast forward a few years and a new VP of the Dept the Contact Center is in is assigned to head up the dept. He goes over some of the reporting and does not like the numbers. I just heard this via hearsay. My thinking is \"I guess some changes may need to be made personell wise to achieve the numbers you want\". Mind you i just said this in my head, i never expressed this to anyone. It was just a thought. A couple of weeks go by and i get a call asking to attend a meeting later that day. No big deal i get to the conference room and its the VP of the Contact Center, and the Contact Center supervisors. We all exchange pleasantries and they get to meat of why they asked me here.\n\n  \nVP - \"We been looking at these reporting numbers and we don't think that they are right\"  \n\n\nMe - \" What do you think is off with the numbers\"  \n\n\nVP - \"Call Center Supervisor #1, can you explain further?\"  \n\n\nCall Center Supervisor #1 - \"These numbers are all off. We think some of these people had to be taking more calls than this. Something must be wrong with the system  \n\n\nMe - \"Let me know exactly what report you are running and i'll look into it.\"  \n\n\nThey send me the name of the report and off i go into report land. The land of pulling numbers from a database and checking on its accuracy. After a couple of days of trouble shooting i'm really not seeing anything wrong. I note my findings via email and don't hear anything back. I'm thinking the matter is closed but little do i know in an exective meeting its being told that the numbers are \"way off\" and LongIsland is wrong and does not have a clue. The system is wrong.\"  \n\n\nNow i have no problem being wrong but in this case the data is the data. Just because you don't like whats in the report doesn't mean I or the report is wrong. Time to step this up a notch. I decided to get on the phone with a few of my contacts at Cisco. I sent them over the reports and we performed a quick webex and determined the reports were indeed legit and made sure i had their verification in Email. I scheduled a meeting with the Cisco Contacts, Contact Center VP, Supervisors and my VP to go over the findings and the meeting sort of went like this.  \nAfter exchanging introductions.  \n\n\nCisco Contact - \"So heard you are having some issues with numbers generated on this particular report.\"  \n\n\nContact Center VP - \"Yeah these number are way off, they cannot be right. We think there is issue with the system.\"  \n\n\nCisco Contact - LongIsland and i went over the system and the numbers thoroughly and i really dont see any issues. Usually in cases like this the customer wants the numbers to reflect what they feel they should reflect. The numbers pulled from the database are just that. They cannot be manipulated in any way. Usually when they don't produce the results you want that is a personell issue not a data issue. We do have a few consultants that can help you acheive the numbers you are trying to attain. if you like i can reach out to them on your behalf.\"  \n\n\nSilence  \n\n\nMe - I guess we will have to take this offline.

It took days to produce the company reports, due to a lot of it being gathered by hand from the various departments. My job was to automate the reports by getting data directly from the database. (But since I wasn't technically part of the IT group, I wasn't allowed to actually connect to the database; I had to get a text file dump every night, which I then had to import into an Access database [because I wasn't allowed to have real database software], and then run the reports. The process got worse from there, but that's a story for another time.)\n\nIf I had a nickel for each time I had to hear \"the report is wrong\" or \"the numbers are off\" because the actual data didn't make some regional manager look as good as his self-reported numbers did, I could have retired.\n\nThe coup de grace was when I got hired back to do reporting on one of their daily projects (another long story). The deal was, I had to come in at midnight to run the report, which took a few hours (again, no real database software allowed) so that the executives could have their shiny reports first thing in the morning, but I'd be working half a day for full-time pay. Except it never worked out that way, because every morning I'd get called in because \"the numbers are wrong\", and I'd spend a full day figuring out what was wrong. They were right, though; when I re-evaluated the report, it was wrong. \n\nIt took a few days before my boss and I discovered the problem. As we were researching some of the specific records they said were missing, we actually caught them changing the data -- we literally watched records change before our eyes.

They also glued a washer over the broken end of the pulley. The string couldn't slip off anymore, but may still catch on the remaining broken part from time to time. I suppose that will have to do until a replacement part was obtained. The boss knew what it needed so if he wanted me to order it myself, I figured he would say so.\n\nYou may remember that I mentioned a missing ground prong on the plug. I included that in the email to my boss about the claw machine. We didn't originally get the machine like that, it broke off in an outlet while it was at our store. We didn't have any replacement plugs OR cords that I knew of, but in this disorganized mess of a store, who could say? \n\nA couple weeks later, on a day where the boss wasn't there, a customer complained that the claw machine shocked him. I described what an electric shock from AC felt like and asked if it felt like that, or more like a static shock. He said it felt like AC was present. So I asked him to, without touching the machine, point to what shocked him. He pointed to the metal box where the joystick and coin slots were. I told him, thanks. He left the store without another word. \n\nI grabbed my little voltage detector pen, and turned it on, testing it on a known-live outlet before I \"trusted\" it. I poked the metal box with it. The pen lit up and beeped. Ruh roh. I then poked the metal decorative trim that ran up the corners/edges, which surrounded the decorative \"rope lights\" or \"strip lights\". This too was live. Yikes! Even the metal frame of the front door was live, with 110 VAC.\n\nThis needed to be unplugged, IMMEDIATELY, and not hooked back up until it was repaired. The trouble was moving the machine back so I could remove the plug without touching either 1: The metal trim up the corners, 2: the coin/controller box, or 3: The metal frame of the front door. I didn't have any insulated gloves, and even if I did, I was wearing a short sleeved shirt and didn't have a coat to cover my arms, due to the weather that day. I asked my coworker if he knew which breaker controlled that set of outlets where the claw machine was. He said he didn't know. I told him that he should shut down the computer, because it might lose power. He asked why, and I explained the claw machine was shocking people, and I couldn't reach the plug without touching the machine, so I needed to find the breaker, and that might mean the computer would lose power. He said he needed the computer to stay on. I literally facepalmed right in front of him, and said \"I don't think you understand, there is high voltage on the outside of the machine. The outside that people can touch. That means someone could get electrocuted, and we would get sued. That could put us out of business, which means we would all lose our jobs. No one's lives are depending on that computer right now, nor is our business.\"\n\nWith that, I went to the breaker room and took a few guesses. I went back out to the floor, and I had indeed shut off the outlet cluster that fed the claw machine. I pulled the machine away from the wall and unplugged it. I opened up the back cover and removed the fuse, putting a big DANGER note covering the fuse slot. This was inside the machine. Since the machine was on wheels, I went ahead and wheeled it to the back room, and then I turned the breakers back on. \n\nI called the boss and left a message explaining why the claw machine had been moved to the back room. \n\nI took the cord and tried using a continuity checker to zero in on the source of the problem. I measured between the hot prong and the metal parts on the outside, but the checker didn't beep or light up. I figured if it did, I could disconnect parts of the machine one by one until I found where the short was. Unfortunately, the continuity checker isn't seeing it, so it's probably a case of slight leakage from something rather than a dead short. So I armed myself with the multimeter and voltage detector pen from before. \n\nI went through a similar process that I'd originally planned, but with the ohms setting on my meter. I measure between the hot prong and the metal trim on the machine. It should either be open or at least in the mega-ohms, but it's lower resistance than that. Not a dead short, though, so it probably isn't an actual frayed wire touching the inside of one of the metal parts. So I disconnected one light fixture inside the machine, but the leakage was still there. I disconnected another light fixture, the leakage was still there. I disconnected the power supply... bingo! There was leakage between Hot and Ground on the power supply. \n\nThe ground strap is supposed to be connected to the inside of all user-accessible metal trim, so that if a hot wire touches it from inside, it shorts out and blows a fuse/breaker. However, with the third prong missing on the plug, the ground strap instead carried the fault current from the power supply to all the outside metal parts of the machine. I reconnected the lights, but left the power supply box disconnected. The power supply was 24V for the motors and 5V for the control board. Great, that shouldn't be hard to find. I labeled the wires for the power supply outputs so we'd know where the wires were supposed to go on the new power supply when we got one. \n\nWe lacked any ticketing or record keeping system for repairs of machines that belonged to us, so I just wrote on a blank piece of paper that the machine needed a new 24V/5V power supply, and a new cord or plug (The missing ground prong was the reason the machine became live on the outside. With a ground prong, the fuse would have simply blown instead, or lower current leakage would just harmlessly go to ground) \n\nI worked on some other machines, did some cleaning and busy work until closing time and went home for the day. \n\nThe next day, I see the claw machine back out on the floor already. Given that both of my coworkers had a track record of disregard for electrical safety, I had little doubt it was still a shock risk. Indeed, I grabbed my voltage detector pen, poked the metal coin door with it, and found that it was live, again! They had hooked the same power supply back up again, and didn't replace the plug! If they had done *either* the machine wouldn't be live! But where did they get another fuse? I pulled out the original, and we didn't have any in stock as far as I knew. Unless.... You guessed it, they bypassed the fuse to get the machine running again, effectively going for double Jeopardy: Now you can get shocked AND burn the store down! Of course, what else are claw machines for?\n\nI called my boss and, since he of course didn't pick up, I basically left a message saying that someone else had undone all my safety measures and put the machine back out on the floor, still unrepaired, still a shock hazard to customers who simply wanted to play the machine. This time, the machine was in a different position and I was able to safely reach the plug without pulling the breaker first. \n\nI honestly can't imagine how the idiot managed to plug it in without touching the metal parts, which would have immediately clued him in that neither I nor the customer were joking when we said it was shocking people. \n\nNow you're all saying \"cut the plug off\" and yes, in hindsight I probably could have done that. However, I figured the boss might consider that destruction of the store's property (even though that would be the first step to putting a new plug on the end of the cord) which is why I didn't do that. That said, I had pretty much run out of any other options that didn't involve physical violence. \n\nAfter unplugging the machine, I disconnected the power supply from the inside, then plugged it back in so the lights would be on, therefore my idiot coworkers would be none the wiser until/unless they actually tried to play it, or looked at the little LED screen that was supposed to show the credits and time. \n\nTo be clear, the machine was now technically safe to touch for people. It just wouldn't work with the power supply disconnected, but it wouldn't shock people either.\n\nWhoever pulled it back out was clearly fixated on having a claw machine out on the floor. Therefore, I decided to look and see if we had a power cord and power supply from another machine so we could have the claw machine working again. \n\nI asked my coworkers if they knew of any machines that we could use for parts. They both said no. I asked if they knew of anything else that used a 24V supply. They had no idea. Well, thanks for nothing, I guess.\n\nThis was the only claw machine we had in the store, so using another one for parts (or using this one for parts to fix that one) wasn't an option. I went to the back room and checked if we had any power supplies. Finding anything back there was always a chore due to the lack of organization. I found that most of them were 12 V power supplies. I didn't think wiring them in series for 24V would actually work due to the capacitors in the power supply, and I'd hate to ruin a good power supply trying it. \n\nWell, I decided to take a closer look at some other machines to see if their power supplies will work. Nah, most of them are 12 volts. But, a long-deceased driving game (the motherboard quit) with a force feedback motor on the steering wheel had a 24V power supply that still worked! I put a note on the machine \"Power supply removed for claw machine up front, PS make / model was x/y, specs were z\" so if anyone objected, they could revert it to it's original state, and if they found a replacement motherboard, they'd know what power supply to get. Now for the cord.\n\nEvery machine I could find back there had the ground prong missing. What the heck is it with the lack of ground prongs? Pretty much everything in the back either belonged to a customer, or appeared to be a \"scrap\" machine. But there was nothing I could \"steal\" an intact cord from, all the good ones had long since been taken to fix other machines, and none of them had been replaced. At this point I had already mentioned to the boss that we needed more cords or plugs, so I decided to not pester him about it.\n\nWell, I could at least half-fix the machine. With the wires already labeled, I unplugged the machine, removed the old power supply and connected the wires to the new one. I put the fuse back in, but did not connect the \"hot\" wire from the cord back to the new PSU, since we still needed to fix the missing ground issue. I figured if they saw the machine was \"working\" again, they wouldn't see the need to fix the ground issue. \n\nA few days later, I noticed someone playing the machine. At least they weren't getting shocked, but out of curiosity, I looked at the cord when they were done playing. What do you know, a new plug was put on. It was even done properly, what more do you want? Other than a new pulley, where the original still had a washer glued on it. \n\nA few more days later, the inevitable happened and the washer came unglued, allowing the string to tangle up again. I asked around about what kind of glue was used, so that I could try a different kind of glue, but no one knows what was originally used. I wasn't sure anything would work that well between metal and plastic. With the string tangled up, I was worried that if someone tried to play the machine, the up/down motor might burn out or the gears could strip. Therefore, I disconnected the power supply inside the machine once again.\n\nI had figured that sometime the next day, I could try super glueing the washer back on. The beginning of that day, I turned the machines on like always. I was the only one who turned them off after closing, my coworkers left them on. A few minutes later, I hear the dreaded sound of \"capacitor popcorn\" coming from the general direction of the claw machine. \n\nSure enough, the claw machine was quickly filling with smoke. I unplugged it quickly and grabbed the fire extinguisher and flung the door open. There were no actual flames, so rather than actually spray, I waited to see if the smoke died down on it's own. Thankfully, it did. It was coming from the motherboard and the power supply. Oh fsck.\n\nI took a closer look and found that one of the connectors had been pulled out, but then put back in backwards. To be fair, they weren't keyed which meant this was possible without the use of a hammer. However, the connectors didn't need to be unplugged to begin with. I unscrewed the board and approached my coworker.\n\nMe: \"Were you messing with the claw machine, by any chance?\" \nIdiot: \"Yeah, the machine wasn't working again so I figured I could pull the connectors out and put them back in again and it would work\"\nMe: \"Well you put it in backwards\"\nIdiot: \"So? Just put it back the right way\"\nMe: (Screaming internally, I put the board where it's plainly visible to him, with all the burned traces, popped capacitors and chips with craters in them, all visible) \"It's destroyed. You reverse a connector or put it in the wrong hole, this is what happens. Did you not see all that smoke or hear those popping noises?

Even with the manufacturer's name in hand, I couldn't even find a picture of it, let alone a manual. This meant that finding an entire circuit board, or even just a programmed microcontroller, would have been darn near impossible. Okay, I suppose it would be technically possible, but only to the extent that winning the lottery would also be \"technically possible\". In other words, realistically, we were never going to find another motherboard for this machine. It's fate was sealed.\n\nTL;DR: Claw machine gets a band-aid fix for the broken pulley. Later on, a deadly electrical short occurs and both my coworkers insist that it remain plugged in despite it being a death trap. I fixed the short by replacing the power supply. Someone replaced the plug, properly. But then, one of the idiots tried \"fixing\" the machine by reseating the connectors, but accidentally reversed it and burned out the motherboard.","score":229,"comments":[{"body":"Christ, reading this makes me wonder how the hell that place stayed in business.\n\nI know the gaming machine industry is dodgy as fuck, but this is ridiculous!","score":96,"comments":[{"body":"Not surprisingly, the store went bankrupt a few months later.

So I sent it it for them to fix it under warranty. I got it back two weeks later - the JAZ drive had been checked by the original manufacturer and came back as \"without fault\", and I was billed for that test. I tested it extensively on the same day, and behold, it had gotten worse. Then a friend of mine noticed that he got shocked on the external box. We measured ~115V (230V is AC here) on the SCSI cable ground. Despite the device still under warranty, we opened it, put the JAZ drive in a different enclosure, and it worked like a charm. The external box, without the drive, still had AC on the case.\n\nSo I called them and informed them about our findings, and they told me that they had simply taken out the drive and sent it in, and never tested the case with the power supply as such.

Ever since I had started there, the claw had been stuck: it would move forward, backward, left and right, but not up and down.\n\nI took it upon myself to try and figure out the problem. First, I opened it up and unscrewed the cover over the \"box\" that held the mechanism that moved the claw up and down. One of the plastic pulleys was broken in such a way that the little string could slip off and get stuck. Indeed, the string was already tangled up every which way. Now, I hadn't dealt with a claw machine before, so some kind of manual would help if I could find one. I'll also need to figure out who built the thing to be able to order a part for it. \n\nNow, the claw machine had a name on the \"marquee\" but it did not show a manufacturer's name. I opened up the machine and look for any evidence of who made the thing. There is none: the machine is literally built with no-name parts. The motors, the board, the power supply, all lack any manufacturer's name on them. On an unrelated note, I found a manual for a completely different machine, stuffed inside this claw machine.\n\nWell, the machine itself obviously wasn't the best place to find the manufacturer's info in this case. So I punted and just Googled (name of machine) claw machine. \n\nWell, disappointingly, after going through page after page (while doing other things around the store in between) I found practically nothing pointing me in the direction of who made this thing, or even, for that matter, if the company still exists.\n\nLater, someone found an old brochure online from a well-known arcade game manufacturer, advertising the machine. A company that was still in business! Great! So I called them up. \n\nOops, premature celebration. It turns out that company also used to *sell* other machines that they themselves did not make, and this was one of them. The company that actually made the machine itself had long since gone bankrupt. The support rep also didn't know of any machines that shared any parts with this one. But on the other hand, I am now armed with the name of the original manufacturer, so I may not be able to order original parts, but I could probably find information about how this thing is supposed to work so that I can rethread the string properly.\n\nArmed with the name of the manufacturer, I turned to Google again. I Googled and Googled until my Googler was sore, and, for the lack of a phrase that rhymes, I found ZERO evidence that the manufacturer *ever* existed or what they made.\n\nI had tried (name with an A) and (other name with an O) in case I heard the guy wrong over the phone. I tried it as one word, and as two words. None of which yielded any additional results to even tell me which name was accurate.\n\nIn short, I was back to square one.\n\nThe next time I came back to this machine, I decided to try finding parts another way. I used calipers to take measurements of the pulleys that the string wrapped around, so that I could order replacements whose measurements matched. \n\nAs I looked up claw machine parts, I was rather disconcerted to find that, out of everyone that makes or sells parts for claw machines in general, *all* of them listed the specific machine(s) that the parts would fit and *none* of them listed the dimensions! So my measurements weren't worth a quarter.\n\nLater on, a light bulb came on over my head. Perhaps some industrial suppliers might sell pullies for other purposes that happen to match the size, or at least be close enough? After all, there's nothing particularly extravagent or unusual about these pullies as far as I can tell. \n\nI spent some time searching around industrial machine suppliers that took small-quantity orders. I decided to simply forward links to the product pages to my boss, so that he could research the actual suppliers and decide on which one was the best one to use. I also forwarded the measurements as well, in case he had another kind of machine with a similar enough part to fit, or for that matter, try to fabricate something. I also pointed out that the plug was missing the ground prong, so we would need to order more replacement plugs unless we had some somewhere that I didn't know about.\n\nStay tuned for the second part of the story.","score":173,"comments":[{"body":"You left us hanging.

In accordance with the rules, the names of the people and businesses involved have been changed.\n\nThis story goes back to the early 2000's.  I was working for an IT support company located in the city of New Bedford, Massachusetts.  New Bedford has a rich fishing history and was once considered to be \"the whaling capital of the world\".  In fact, the story of \"Moby Dick\" takes place in this very city.  However, at the time this story takes place, New Bedford would more accurately be described as \"the Mos Eisley of Massachusetts\" - you would never find a more wretched hive of sum and villainy.  Especially on the waterfront.\n\nThe fishing industry being the main center of commerce for New Bedford, many of our clients were in this line of business.  One client in particular, Stormy Seas Fisheries, is at the center of this story.  Stormy Seas was a good client.  They were easy to deal with, paid their bills, rarely complained, and were not too demanding.  We enjoyed supporting them.\n\nOne day I walked into the office and the owner of the IT company, his wife, and several employees, were standing around talking with concerned looks on their faces.  There was a story in one of the local newspapers which reported Stormy Seas was the victim of a literal \"hostile takeover\" where a man named James Greco literally held a gun to the owner's face and informed him he would be taking over.  We came to learn that James was a major figure of organized crime in the area.\n\nThe discussion was about what to do about the situation.  As I said, Stormy Seas was a great client and we'd hate to lose them.  After some deliberation the decision was made to keep them on and just see how it goes.  So we did, and things went along just as before.  We'd show up onsite, the same people were there, no weird vibes, no red flags, no sign of this mysterious organized crime figure.  Stormy Seas continued to pay their bills no questions asked and we happily continued supporting them.\n\nThis went along for several months, and honestly most of us had forgotten all about the whole hostile takeover bit because as I said, no weirdness came out of it.  Then one day we got a call from a woman we had never heard of but who claimed to work for Stormy Seas Fisheries and was reporting a problem with the internet connection at their house and asked if we could urgently send someone by.  We weren't really in the business of doing residential work, but since Stormy Seas was such a good client we figured we'd do them a favor and send someone.  That someone ended up being me.  Me, a young and naïve 20-something with too much innocence and zeal for his own good. So I drove out to the address in a wealthy part of a neighboring town.  As I pulled up to the house I drove past a Ford Explorer SUV with dark tinted windows and bristling with antennas sitting on the side of the road near the end of the driveway.  I thought that was odd but I paid it no mind as I pulled into the driveway and arrived at what locals would have described as a \"Portuguese Palace\".  Those familiar with the area would know what I mean.  An expansive front lawn lined by a wrought iron fence, a long gravel driveway leading to an ornate concrete staircase with concrete lion gargoyles on either side, terminating at a large house with a brick and stucco finish and a gigantic wooden door.\n\nI strolled up to the door and rang the bell.  It opened, and I was suddenly faced with what could best be described as a human grizzly bear who dwarfed my wiry 5'11\" frame.  A large, imposing man who looked like he hadn't shaved or changed clothes in about a week.  Taken aback, I looked up at the man, held out my hand and sheepishly said \"Hi, I'm Dark Helmet, I'm here to fix the computer.\n\n\"The man smiled, gripped my hand with his giant meat paw and said \"Hey, nice to meet you!  Jimmy Greco!\"\n\nI felt my entire body tense up.  I tried to maintain my composure but I'm pretty certain my eyeballs were bulging out of my head as I remembered the newspaper story as an image of this man stalking into the office of Stormy Seas Fisheries and holding a gun to the owner's head flashed before my eyes.\n\nI think I blacked out a bit because the next memory I have is of me in the living room sitting at the computer at a desk in the corner, pecking away, while Jimmy sat on the couch to my left.  I glanced over at him and I noticed a bulge under one of his pant legs near the ankle.  An ankle bracelet, I realized.  Suddenly it all came together.  Jimmy's disheveled appearance.  The unmarked SUV watching the house.  The urgent need to repair the internet.  This man was under house arrest!  I would later learn the SUV belonged to the FBI.\n\nSo Jimmy was sitting there just jabbering my ear off with small talk.  He seemed almost giddy to have someone new to talk to.  By the way, you have to imagine his voice in the stereotypical baritone NY City gangster accent you hear in movies, because that's exactly what he sounded like.\n\n\"So anyways, what'd you say your name was again kid?\"\n\nI replied nervously, \"Dark Helmet\".\n\nJimmy leaned back and pensively said, \"Helmet… Helmet… I know a few Helmet's…\"\n\nMe: \"Yeah, well I know my uncle Bill is friends with Chris.\"  (Chris was another guy who worked at Stormy Seas, and my uncle was notorious for having friends in low places.)\n\nJimmy cocked his head to the side in thought as he pondered. \"Hmmm… Helmet… Billy Helmet… Hey, didn't he have a twin brother?\"\n\nNot really sure where this was going I replied, \"Yeah, Tom.  That's my dad.\" (They are identical twins.)\n\nJimmy's eyes narrowed as he leaned forward towards me, gesturing with his index finger at me as he spoke.  Sort of jabbing at the air towards me with his finger.\n\n\"Yeah, Tom Helmet!  TOM HELMET!\"  He said excitedly, his eyes gleaming.  \"You know, I was in Walpole once.  He was one of my CO's!\"\n\nWalpole was a prison.  CO stands for Corrections Officer.  Prison guard in layman's terms.  Yes, my dad worked there.\n\nI froze and just stared blankly at the screen in front of me as I felt the blood drain away from my face.  \"I'm dead.  I am never leaving this house alive.  I'm going to be killed and dismembered and buried in this man's back yard.\"  These thoughts raced through my head as I tried to judge my ability to spring from my chair and dash out the door before Jimmy had time to leap from the couch and tackle me.\n\nThen, the unexpected happened.  Jimmy relaxed and leaned back as his face brightened and he said, \"You know, he was a REALLY nice guy!\"\n\nI'm pretty sure I visibly breathed a sigh of relief and relaxed as I felt the color return to my face.  Jimmy went on and regaled me of stories of my father's kindness while he was imprisoned in Walpole.  Come to find out, my dad was the night kitchen officer.  Some inmates who had certain dietary needs or medical conditions were allowed a carton of milk in their cell after hours.  Jimmy at the time was a young 18 year old kid.  My dad took pity on him and would bring him any extra milk he had, even though Jimmy technically wasn't allowed to have it in his cell.\n\nI still had work to do and Jimmy was still talkative so the banter continued.\n\n\"So, you got any brothers or sisters?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have a younger sister.\"\n\n\"Oh, and what does she do for work?\"\n\n\"She's a massage therapist.\"\n\n\"Oh, yeah?  Massage Therapy, that's nice!  You know, last year for Christmas the guys from the office got me one of those you know \"massage a month\" type deals.  Dumb \\[expletive\\] only showed up three times and stopped coming.  I oughta send someone out to bust her knee caps.  Hey, you should give me your sister's number!\"\n\n\"Yeah… uh…  I'll uh… give it to Chris and he can give it to you.\"\n\n\"Thanks, kid!\"\n\nSpoiler: I didn't.\n\nThis is where our story concludes.  I have absolutely no recollection of what the actual problem was with the computer or internet connection.  I do remember texting my dad on the way down the driveway something like \"Hi dad, Jimmy Greco says hi and thanks for the milk!\" and I waved to the FBI folks as I drove past.  My license plate number and description of my vehicle is probably enshrined in an FBI file in Boston somewhere.  That was the last time we ever saw or heard from Jimmy Greco.  Shortly after these events he was tried and convicted, but he was released from prison in 2011.","score":694,"comments":[{"body":"Lol I've had a bit of experience with similar people in more of a social context...

Some of them only had a soft-start routine along with current protection (so if something stopped the motor from turning, it wouldn't burn out) but others allowed an input from an external system to control them. The soft start ability would save energy in the long run for things that had to cycle on and off a lot.\n\nThe previous owners of the building also had the need to test certain things on 220VAC as well. How did they do this? No, of course they didn't use a proper outlet into which only 220VAC plugs would fit. They wired a regular 110VAC outlet to be 220VAC instead. You can probably guess where this is going.\n\nSo as I understand it, they wanted to use the power strip as a convenient switch for their motor. The power strip they chose was also a surge protector, which by definition does something to prevent an excessive voltage from reaching devices plugged into it. There are power strips that are JUST power strips, and we had several of those, which didn't give a hoot about the input voltage. Surge protectors, on the other hand, *must* react to an overvoltage, by definition.\n\nI was working on something else when my coworker brought me the surge protector. He admitted that he hooked it up to 220 and it went \"pop\" and didn't work anymore. I set it aside, and kept at my current project until I was done with it. \n\nLater on, I had nothing better to do, so I decide to take apart the surge protector, assuming there's any way to do so non-destructively in the first place. And indeed, there was. It wasn't designed intentionally to *prevent* repairs, but it wasn't designed with repairs in mind, either. I'll leave it at that. \n\nI was looking for a fuse, but before I even found it, I saw the problem. The traces that once carried the input power were *gone* and the surface of the board itself has two big burn marks where the traces used to be. There actually *was* a thermal fuse next to the MOVs, as well as a circuit breaker which was part of the switch. Both of which did diddly squat. I'll explain in a comment how (most) surge protectors work.\n\nI showed my coworker the burned up board, and he thankfully didn't try to get me to \"fix\" it. \n\nTL;DR: electrical codes exist for a reason.

If the voltage spike is of a short enough duration and isn't an extreme one, the MOV will return to normal, that is, open.\n\nFor an extreme voltage spike (like lightning) or a sustained over voltage, a lot of current would flow: enough to blow a fuse or circuit breaker.

Get the organization, country and more importantly the entire IP block of that ISP, and manually blacklist the whole subnet in the software firewall.

Don't harvest! Harvest.

We have a \"Corporate PDM\" group for our team's stuff. If any other organization at the company needs to assign a ticket to us, they just put it in the \"Corporate PDM\" group and we get notified of it. There is even a document in the ticketing system, so if you search for \"PDM\" then this document comes up and says, \"Assign to the 'Corporate PDM' group.\" We can see on a ticket if someone searched for such a ticketing system document and indicated it was the solution.\n\nOur corporation acquired another company a few years back. One thing that Old Company -- let's call them OLDco -- had in-progress was an attempt to put a PDM system in place.\n\nAt first, it sounded like our PDM group would have to provide support to the users of this other PDM system, but our management wanted it kept separate from our \"normal\" tickets. So we created a new group in the ticketing system, called \"Corporate PDM - OLDco\" to be distinctive.\n\nAfter having done that, and after the folks at that acquired company saw our PDM system, they decided to abandon their project. We never used the group, and we dropped members from it, so no one got notifications about it.\n\nOur mistake was in not requesting deletion of the \"Corporate PDM - OLDco\" group at that time.\n\nEvery so often, the ticketing system people see this unused group and decide to harvest it. They ask me, and I say to go ahead. Then they come back and say they can't, there's a ticket in it.\n\nLo and behold, they are right. Such tickets are put in by folks in IT helpdesks in other countries. We all use the same ticketing system, but apparently they hear that someone was once part of OLDco, so they look for groups with OLDco in the name to assign the ticket. It is important to understand that there are no ticketing system help documents that tell anyone to use the \"Corporate PDM - OLDco\" group. Not one. So these other helpdesk people are not following proper procedure in assigning tickets.\n\nSo, I take the tickets (which are weeks or months old at that point), reassign them to the proper group, ask the IT agent who assigned them to the wrong place why they did it, and to update whatever documentation they are using, because they shouldn't do this again.\n\nBut the next time a harvest cycle comes around, the same problem crops up with someone else who put a ticket in there. It's like playing whack-a-mole with a game that's been put in storage, but someone won't unplug it while a mole is sticking up, and they won't let the person who whacks the mole do the unplugging.\n\nIt feels like I've been doing this every quarter of the last two years. Today, I got ahold of someone who is involved in the harvest process, and he says they will expedite the harvest, hopefully it will happen tomorrow.\n\nI'm keeping my fingers crossed, but I am not holding my breath.","score":285,"comments":[{"body":"Would be nice if you could automatically reroute tickets back out again.

They also rented machines out for events and parties and such.\n\nThis place for the most part had actual competent techs working for it. Unfortunately, I wasn't so great at helping to move large items, and they needed that more than they needed a full time tech due to their rentals and events, therefore I had a relatively short period of employment there.\n\nOne day, we got a call from a bar that our shooting game was initially starting up okay when they turned it on upon opening up the bar, but later on it would black out and show \"no signal\" on the screen. (yes, some arcade monitors do that). We knew by the title, that this was one of those games that had a computer tower inside acting as the \"brain\" of the game rather than a custom arcade motherboard. This also meant that the tower in some cases used a standard ATX power supply, which we had several of laying round as spares for these types of games. \n\nAfter finding a power supply and verifying it worked using our tester, I headed over to the bar. \n\nIt was soon enough after opening that the machine had not shut itself down yet, but I decided to do some exploratory \"surgery\" on it rather than just wait around for it to go wrong. I opened the back cover with the key, and thankfully, there is plenty of room around the tower to take it's cover off while it's still in place. I popped the cover off, and I saw that the CPU fan wasn't turning anymore. Well, darn. I don't think we have a spare of that. On the other hand, we caught it before the actual CPU failed: score one for whoever designed this motherboard. Clearly the computer was going into thermal shutdown. \n\nI noted in the ticket that the CPU fan was broken, and I took pictures of both the fan itself and the model number on the computer tower case, so that we could figure out what fan to order, or find a broken tower of the same model to pull a fan from.\n\nEven with thermal throttling and shutdown, it's not wise to continue to run something that has improper cooling, because hitting the upper limit repeatedly is still a good way to cause failure sooner or later. The machine had a removable power cord, so I decided to take it with me - and let the bar manager know the reason I was taking it with me. He appeared to understand so I went on my way. I also made a call to the boss and explained the whole thing. \n\nFast forward about 4 weeks.\n\nWhile I was out replacing the monitor on another machine in a different location, I got a call from my boss. He said that (same shooting game) is broken down at (address) and just showing \"No Signal\" on the screen. The address sounded familiar, but I didn't make the connection in the moment. As I got closer to the location, the realization hit that it's the same one I had found the fan broken in..... But how did they even get to the point of saying \"No Signal\"? \n\nI entered the bar and just as I suspected, there was another power cord attached and plugged in. Sure enough, the screen is saying \"No Signal\". I tried to reboot it, however, instead of the single short \"beep\" that this machine usually made on startup, I get an ominous series of long beeps. I forget what the pattern was offhand, but it wasn't what you would want to hear when booting up a computer.\n\nI took the back cover off again and found that whoever put the new power cord on hadn't even closed up the tower so it was still open. More importantly, the fan was still broken, so the CPU had been started and forced to run up to it's limits multiple times. \n\nNormally, I would try reseating the RAM and possibly the CPU and graphics card to see if that fixes the problem. My hope of that working here was quite thin, knowing what's happened, but I might as well try something while I'm here. \n\nI pulled out the RAM first amd put it back in. No change. Then I tried the graphics card. No change. The thing I saved for last, because it's not a pleasant task due to the thermal paste, is the CPU. Well, whatever, I might as well get it over with. So, I unscrewed the heat sink, removed it, undid the lock on the CPU socket and removed the CPU, then put it back in and reattached the heat sink. Lights, Camera, Action! Power on and, just as I suspected, no change. I get the same error beeps. Drat. \n\nI called my boss to see if he knew anything about the power cord finding it's way back to the bar.\n\nIt turns out that he had gotten a call that \"the power cord is missing\" and he had just sent one of the other employees out there with another power cord, and that guy had just plugged it in, and when it booted up in front of him he (understandably) assumed all was well. However, neither that employee OR my boss had bothered to look at the ticket. The restaurant manager didn't mention anything either, and apparently assumed the problem was fixed or forgot what I had said, and didn't unplug the machine. \n\nI calmly reminded my boss to check the ticket from 4 weeks ago that had my name on it. After a moment of silence on his part, he surprisingly doesn't find a way to blame me, for once. Score one for him, but that's about all he got due to his generally poor attitude. Well, maybe two because he wouldn't have stood for the kind of crap that went on at the other game room store I had worked for previously. \n\nThe guy who didn't look at the ticket got an earful from the boss, but I don't think that was entirely fair because the boss could have checked the ticket himself, or the call-taker if it wasn't the boss. (I don't know who picked up the \"power cord is missing\" call). I told that employee that I didn't blame him.\n\nTL;DR: The crap hit the fan, but the fan wasn't working anymore so the crap just stayed there.","score":896,"comments":[{"body":"This is why both lockout and tagout are important.","score":273,"comments":[{"body":"There are actually lockable shrouds that can be placed over a plug to stop it from being used, as well as the holes that most U.S. plugs have, could fit a \"luggage lock\" if the need arises. \n\nSince I obviously had keys to the machine, one thing I could have done in hindsight was disconnect the power inlet lead INSIDE the machine and left a note inside for other techs \"replace CPU fan first\" and this would have achieved the same effect.","score":210,"comments":[{"body":"I dunno, they didn't read the previous ticket, what makes you think they would read the note/sign?","score":92,"comments":[{"body":"To quote the title of another reddit story, \"It only takes a bit of stupid to break a whole lot of smart\"","score":113,"comments":[]},{"body":"prob missed reading the ticket that's on the computer but the tech will easily see and read a note on the machine that they're going to fixed. the owner of that restaurant could see that note too and wouldn't have called back.","score":29,"comments":[{"body":"","score":0,"comments":[]}]},{"body":"You can put a sign where they have to at least move it out of their way to do their job.\n\nNo excuses at that point.","score":17,"comments":[{"body":"","score":0,"comments":[]}]},{"body":"","score":0,"comments":[]}]},{"body":"","score":0,"comments":[]}]}]},{"body":"I love the tl;dr!","score":31,"comments":[]},{"body":"Wouldn't the bar owner be upset as the machine has been sitting unusable for a simple CPU fan swap for a month.","score":88,"comments":[{"body":"The boss forgot about it needing a fan.

He had no home internet and this was before smartphones or mobile internet were common.\n\nI don’t remember the specifics but you’ll get the idea of the spiral he was in.\n\nC: “Why won’t the XP installer see my hard drives??”\n\nMe: “What does it say in the BIOS?”\n\nC: “SE\\]&amp;/TE B;@#ACUD?”\n\nMe: “IDE conflict, check your jumpers on both hard drives” (for he had two)\n\nC pulls the drives and cables out and examines them, corrects the jumper settings.\n\nC: “Cool it shows up properly as SEAGATE BARRACUDA now!” (and whatever the other one was)\n\nC proceeds to install.\n\nC: “It’s bombed out! Why did the install fail?”\n\nMe: “Test the HDD?”\n\nC runs a disk diagnostic but it doesn’t yield a pass/fail. There was a fault trying to test it at all.\n\nMe: “Unplug one of the hard drives and try with the minimum plugged in”\n\nC pulls drives and cables out again, unplugs one drive.\n\nC: “It’s still failing”\n\nMe: “Ok well we didn’t get a valid test before, lets try the diag tool again”\n\nC: “It’s still not able to test the drive properly”\n\nMe: “Try the other drive”\n\nC pulls drives and cables out again, swaps them over.\n\nC: “Install failing on this one too!”\n\nMe: “Right, test that drive”\n\nC: “Same thing! Still can’t run the test!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can imagine he’s been at it since before I arrived, poor thing. Nothing makes sense, nothing works, he’s started going through the five stages of grief I think. Denial, Anger and Depression certainly. He’s absolutely miserable after hours into the endeavour.\n\nMe: “umm….”\n\nC is glum. He wants his PC to work. It doesn’t. He can’t fix it. He is very sad. He is a forlorn puppy, tired and defeated.\n\nMe: “S\\*\\*\\* sorry dude. Not much else I can think of without internet to research or download anything”\n\nC: “Yeah I know… no worries, thanks for trying”\n\nI do not like this either. I am autistic, though I won’t know that for another decade and a half. My brain sees a problem and it has the raw, biological impulse to solve it. I must fix it. It is wrong, it must be made right. Some people have called me helpful, some have called me kind even. If you say so, but that’s not what is going on upstairs. I’m glad it benefits others if I can but it’s coincidental to me. One of the most aggravating things for me is when someone says they have a problem with their computer but say no it’s fine I’ll deal with it or get a new one, “BUT I HAVE CABLES.. I HAVE COMPONENTS..”\n\nIt’s the lizard part of my brain. Before thought, before feeling, like the defensive systems wired directly into the nervous system that make you shut your eye before something hits it or to release something picked up much hotter than expected. As the spider waits, as the rabbit flees. Devoid of cunning or cruelty, simply “fix”. No words, no concepts, just “fix”. There is no u/SubstantialTerm3843, only ~~Zuul~~ “fix”.\n\nWithout hope, without witness, without reward.\n\nHundreds of millions of years of evolutionary development gaze down upon the open tower. Untold generations of neurological divergence stare blankly over the motherboard, the jumpers, the drives, the ripples of ribbon cables. Something pure, something of the Divine speaks to me through the static and the tinnitus. I achieve Sennin Mode.\n\nfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixit\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: “If the cables weren’t knackered before all that plugging and unplugging won’t have helped, have you got another IDE cable?”\n\nC gasps, C scurries. C replaces the ribbon cable.\n\nC: “OMG it’s working!! OMG it’s installing!! OMG dude it’s happening!! OMG!! OMG!!”\n\nC is ecstatic. C is back from the brink. C was lost in the dark forest as Dante was, but C gets to skip all that. C is in his own little world, mumbling gratitude but utterly captured in that familiar old screen, the blue background, the green progress bar, the primary colours of the Windows logo. C is awash with tranquillity.\n\nC is presented with the prompt for the product key. C wails, a moan of heartbreaking calamity.\n\nC, to no one: “I don’t suppose anyone has an XP license key?”\n\nC has arrived at Bargaining, but C is bereft. No eye contact, no expectation. C approaches Acceptance.\n\nMe, still placid and blank faced: “ABCDE-“\n\nC, uncomprehending: “…what?”\n\nI nod toward the keyboard.\n\nMe: “ABCDE-“\n\nC dares not to hope, but eyes wide takes direction and begins typing.\n\nMe: “FGHIJ-KLMNO-PQRST-UVWXY”\n\nC presses enter. C remains silent. C needs a moment. C barely breathes for the remainder but soon enough, he is Welcome.  And it’s blue skies, fluffy white clouds and rolling green hills once more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*D\\*O\\*P\\*A\\*M\\*I\\*N\\*E\\*S\\*","score":1201,"comments":[{"body":"You described the impulse to fix perfectly.

USB bridge to my own Macbook, directly connected to a PC with Linux or Windows HFS mount tools, various professional data recovery tools we “downloaded off the internet” at the shop. I managed to get some files back but not all of what Customer was hoping for. I noticed one of these tools was making something like 5 attempts to read the file, timing out and giving up. Running the tool again maybe grabbed some different files but wasn’t going to be time/cost effective to just repeat it and hope for the best, scanning the entire disk for hours each time.\n\nThis gave me the idea to try something, similar to the data recovery tool but with the opposite intention. To transfer a file assuming it would take ages, or if it did fail to be able to set that file aside for another attempt, and not to waste time redoing successfully copied files.

Basically when a location doesn't own their own machines (usually places like restaurants and bars) a company like this either \"rents\" a space for said machine for a flat rate to the location owner, or splits the actual profits from the machine with the location owner.\n\nThis is not the same place that had idiotic techs working for it, that was a store that sold arcade machines.\n\nOne day, we got a call from a restaurant that our entire row of games had stopped working. Okay, that sounds more like a blown breaker in the building than a problem with any of our games. The location owner responded that he tried turning the breaker back on, but it instantly blew again. We offer to check our machines just to be sure, though we were skeptical that it was anything to do with us.\n\nMany arcade and vending machines will have their own fuses, either buried inside the machine, or in a separate little fuse holder in the back, near the power cord. So it seems unlikely that anything to do with our games, except a munched power cord, could actually take down a branch circuit.\n\nWithout going into great detail, I arrived and checked the power cords, which was easy since the machines had already been moved back from the wall. The power cords are fine. A few of our machines have an external fuse holder, so on a hunch, I pop one of them out.\n\nSome idiot had wrapped tinfoil around the fuse on this machine.  All of our techs at this place were well aware of what a fuse is for, and why this is a terrible idea. We always checked fuses on any machine that was new to us. I took pictures for my boss. The two other machines that had external fuse holders had the exact same thing done to them. The kicker was that only one of those machines even had a blown fuse, the other two were fine. I looked inside the machine where the blown fuse was bypassed, and there were several melted wires and the power supply board was fried. I took pictures of that as well.\n\nI delivered the boss the bad news, that (game) had several burned parts and there may be other unseen damage to the motherboard as well, and we wouldn't know until we replaced the obviously bad parts. The power supply board had actual traces burned so it would need to be entirely replaced.\n\nThe restaurant owner had cut corners in other ways while running the restaurant, and in this case, when (game) blacked out on a customer, he just popped out the fuse holder rather than calling the vending company (us) and then wrapped the fuse in tinfoil, rather than replacing it with the proper type. He then proceeded to do the same thing with the other two machines that had external fuse holders accessible from behind. The restaurant owner wouldn't have had to pay a dime for any repairs to the machines, anyway, so we really didn't get why he would do this. We never even gave keys to any location owner, partly to prevent them from screwing stuff up.\n\nOnce the boss found out what had been done with the machines, he put in a priority work order..... to remove ALL of our machines from that restaurant \"before they burn the place down and take our machines with them\". The restaurant surprisingly never burned down, but they did eventually go out of business after multiple code violations were discovered. I was not at all surprised.\n\nTL;DR: Restaurant owner tries to \"fix\" someone else's arcade machine by bypassing the fuse, ends up making it worse. Also goes for double Jeopardy by \"fixing\" the ones that aren't even broken. Restaurant ends up getting \"fired\" as a client due to their \"repairs\".","score":1318,"comments":[{"body":"&gt;\"before they burn the place down and take our machines with them\"\n\n\"And sue us because our machines started the fire.\"","score":467,"comments":[{"body":"Insert *we didn’t start the fire*","score":158,"comments":[{"body":"That would be relevant at the trial, I'm sure, but only after spending tens of thousands of dollars (or more) in legal fees to get to that point.","score":78,"comments":[{"body":"","score":0,"comments":[]}]},{"body":"*It was always burning, since the world's been turning*","score":33,"comments":[{"body":"","score":0,"comments":[]}]},{"body":"","score":0,"comments":[]}]},{"body":"","score":0,"comments":[]}]},{"body":"[At least he didn't replace your fuses with the \"Audio-visual auto-alert\" variety of fuse.](https://i.imgur.com/mUjgor0.jpeg)","score":120,"comments":[{"body":"Ah, that reminds me of the old joke about the rednecks \"fixing\" the lights in their truck and the bullet went off and shot the poor guy in the privates.","score":55,"comments":[{"body":"","score":0,"comments":[]}]}]},{"body":"&gt;but they did eventually go out of business after multiple code violations were discovered.

He’s calling after apparently three hours of failure and is not hiding his frustration. Sigh. He’s actually not completely hopeless with computers so I indulge with this non-trivial problem. This is probably around 2013.\n\nMe: “Ok so what are you trying to do exactly?”\n\nFM: “Install Windows on to this machine”\n\nMe: “And what have you tried so far?”\n\nFM: “I’ve copied all the files over and it won’t boot up”\n\nMe: “Copied them over? From what?”\n\nFM: “My old PC”\n\nMe: “What like with an image?” Surprising, but not impossible. “You restored a backup?”\n\nFM: “Yes I copied everything over and it doesn’t boot”\n\nSo I start thinking along the lines of repair install with drivers while he rambles on a bit. Both machines are XP, “new” PC is old but not as old as his original one. Is x64 but will take his x86 OS if drivers are available, which they still should be? Not insurmountable. \n\nMe: “Ok if you bring it over I don’t mind doing it”\n\nFM: “I can do it! I’m not an idiot! I don’t need you to do it for me!”\n\nYet you are three hours into this, and you have called for my help. \n\nMe: “Ok, there’s only so much I can do over the phone. You’ve moved an OS from one set of hardware to a-very different-nother. I’m not surprised it’s not booting. If you can get drivers and an XP CD I can talk you through a repair installation”\n\nFM: “I shouldn’t need to do all that! It should just work!”\n\nMe: “It won’t necessarily, you’d be quite lucky if it did”\n\nFM: “But that’s how it should work! I know what I’m doing!”\n\nAnd yet… three hours and 10 mins now and I’m trying my best…\n\nMe: “Windows does tie itself to the hardware, there are dependencies, things it relies on. A repair will go through introducing your old OS to your knew hardware, for want of a better term, so they can work together”\n\nFM: “But I’ve copied all the files over, it should just work!”\n\nMe: “What did you use, what software did you image your PC with?

Today on my shift, I came into my shift and clocked in. As I was getting logged into all of our background systems and the phone queue, I was shown a ticket by CW1, CW2, and S. They could not believe what was going on and they piqued my curiosity.\n\nThe person who opened the ticket was PO1, our main point of contact at the station. The ticket reads\n\n**PO1** \\- \"I was told one of the officers switched the routers in Area X and Area Y. Area X continued to have internet with Area Y's router. They switched it back. They think it might be a cord issue. Can someone come verify? Thanks.\"\n\nI had to reread the post 3 times to make sure that I was comprehending it right. I could not believe that someone would touch enterprise-owned equipment without clearance. Keep in mind I am Tier 1 and the clearance to work anywhere near the network infrastructure is Tier 3.  After confirming that my mind was not in fact scrambling works and I read that correctly, I looked at the notes under it and just wow.\n\nThe next message literally just said:\n\n**NG** \\- \"You did what?\"\n\nThis is unusual. We are trained when we start working here that the messages we send through the ticketing software should follow a general email format like:\n\n*Hello \\[caller\\],*\n\n*\\[message\\]*\n\n*Thank you,*\n\n*\\[technician\\]*\n\nThe officer responded:\n\n**PO1** \\- \"That's what I am told. The PO2 asked PC before doing so, and PC approved. Unknown when it occurred.\"\n\nJust what?!!? What does that mean? No disrespect to our PC, they are a pretty awesome person who I have dispatched for in the past and they were always patient and kind to me. But I will say that this person needed help figuring out some very basic computer problems (can't really get specific due to the nature of the work). Apparently, a similar thought passed through our NG's head because his next message is pretty legendary:\n\n**NG** \\- \"This is not acceptable. Specialized equipment should not just be moved by those who don't know how to connect, troubleshoot, or handle specialized equipment. Time after time when we see issues with Area Y it's because either the dongle on the tablet is broken, or some officer has turned wifi off on the tablet. The other month we tested the cable in the squad and it came back \"pass\" in a certification test. What led to the decision to just make this change?

Mostly 40-60 rooms each, and each building had internet advertised as included. Which was an 8Mb connection for a simple home internet package anyone might get for themselves at the time, certainly not to share for a block of flats. All connected to rooms by plain 10/100 switches, or in some cases a managed switch on which we set traffic management rules as a division of the total speed of the internet on the port. Yes really. So if you’re in one of 40 rooms serviced by a 8Mb connection?\n\n~~8096/40= 202.4, so 202Kb/s~~ thanks u/Vektor0. 8196/40 = 204.8 so 204Kb/s for you. Omg looking back I cannot believe we did that. Omg… Omg.\n\nThis one however was a smaller building, 10-15 rooms and I think as it was one that was set up earlier on (before my time at the shop) it was only on 2Mb. Possibly back then 8Mb wasn’t available in that area, lets go with that for this story but the only alternative is the landlords wouldn’t pay for 8Mb. We had frequent complaints naturally which we ignored or said was the best we could offer, then ignored. Sometimes though, they would persist.\n\nThe tenants had come to complain again, as they had a few times already. AsianStudent was mostly the instigator, today she turned up with two more tenants to back her up.\n\nAsianStudent: “The internet is too slow, it’s unacceptable”\n\nMyBoss, Me: “For the thousandth time, it’s not our problem. It’s the best service you’ll get in the area and you have to share”\n\nAsianStudent: “The internet is much faster in \\[AsianCountry\\]!”\n\nMyBoss, Me: “We’re not in \\[AsianCountry\\]”\n\nAsianStudent: “It’s far to slow and we can’t use it to study! And it’s not fair, some of the tenants play games or download illegal videos”\n\nMyBoss, Me: “We don’t police the network, it’s not our problem. We don’t tell people what they can and cannot do with it. Besides it’s no different from you having video skype calls back home to your family”\n\nAsianStudent: “THAT ISN’T THE SAME AT ALL!!”\n\nMyBoss, Me: “It is from a networking perspective”\n\nAsianStudent: “It’s not the same at all!! I just want to speak to my family, the others are breaking the law!!”\n\nMyBoss, Me: “In terms of network traffic it’s no different to anything else, a constant stream of data”\n\nAsianStudent: “No it isn’t”\n\nMyBoss, Me: “We are network engineers and we are telling you IT IS”\n\nAhahahahaha, “network engineers”. I \\*CRINGE\\* at these words. I wouldn’t even describe myself as a network engineer now after over two decades in IT. The ARROGANCE. The HUBRIS. The NOT EVEN KNOWING HOW MUCH WE DIDN’T KNOW.

These are my confessions.\n\nAsianStudent: “If you won’t fix it, we will get our own internet!”\n\nMyBoss, Me: “Ok”\n\nAsianStudent: “..We will do it! Your internet is useless!”\n\nMyBoss, Me: “Go on then”\n\nAsianStudent: “..We are not joking! We will go to a competitor!”\n\nAsianStudent continues to argue with MyBoss, who is undeterred by the threat of rebellion.\n\nJapaneseStudent and I have spoken before and he knows I speak Japanese. To my delight, so does EastEuropeanStudent. Fluently. Even better than I can if I remember right. We get into our own conversation in \\[Japanese\\] while MyBoss and AsianStudent carry on in English. AsianStudent does not understand Japanese.\n\nJapaneseStudent: “\\[The internet really is slow and unacceptable\\]”\n\nEastEuropeanStudent: “\\[It really is a problem, is there nothing you can do?\\]”\n\nMe: “\\[I am sorry, but for the reasons we have repeated many times, this is the fastest service in the area and it is being shared.

It’s really just a matter of who is going to pay for it. We have no issue with how many lines go into the flats. But it’s not for us to say how it’s done.

They exist to make money not spend it. It isn’t for me to discuss really but I assume they would pass on the charges for an extra line, and our work to get it all connected up\\]”\n\nEastEuropeanStudent: \\[And if we do it ourselves? Without the landlord?\\]”\n\nMe: “\\[Well I would have thought you would need their permission. And the ISP may charge an installation fee..\\]”\n\nNow if you have any awareness of Japanese culture, even if through nothing more than Kurosawa films and stereotypes, just know that those stereotypes aren’t based on nothing. That whole thing about honour and shame isn’t really true in the way it’s depicted but it absolutely is a thing. My Japanese is far from perfect but I chose my words carefully..\n\nMe: “\\[..also you would be in charge of the bill.

I've shared it a bunch of times, and I think I may even have the recording lying around somewhere (my supervisor sent it to me as a sort of trophy).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBackground: Early in my tech support career, I worked at a contractor phone center providing Tier 1 support for multiple different companies.  One of these companies made long range radio sets (think like ham radios, long range comms, that kind of thing).  Most of the people who called us were company people who had a service account with them (these would be like logging companies who were in areas that had no cell service, or remote weather observation stations or whatever).  Occasionally we'd get a private caller who maybe owned a radio he got second hand or something, but that was the exception to the rule.  I should also add we didn't really do any actual tech support, we just gathered info and sent it to whatever support team handled the issue.  Finally, I will also mention that on occasion we would get bored and call in ourselves and prank our co-workers.  \n\n\nThe story: so I'm chilling in the office on a slow Saturday when a call comes in.  \n\n\nMe: Thank you for calling \\*company name\\* support, this is Raptor, may I have your first and last name please?\n\nCaller: \\*stammers out his name\\*\n\nThis guy sounded young, like late teen or college age, which is unusual since most of our callers are usually more middle-aged.  He also sounds really nervous, so I just assume he's a newbie who just screwed something up.  I punch in his name into the ticketing system and get no hits, pretty much confirming my suspicions.\n\nMe: I don't seem to be able to find your name in the system.  Is this the first time you've called?\n\nCaller: Uh, yes.\n\nMe: No problem, I just have to create a profile for you.  Can I have a good phone number for?\n\nCaller: \\*begins giving me a phone number, then stops midway through\\* (panicked voice) Um, can you just skip making the profile and help me?\n\nMe: Well, I can get you over to one of the support technicians, but I need more information first, like what kind of issue you're having.\n\nCaller: My microwave exploded and I think radiation is leaking into my room!\n\n(Some of you may see where this is going, trust me, it gets better).\n\nMe, not sure if I'm being pranked or not: I'm sorry?\n\nCaller: I was drying my socks in my microwave, and it exploded!  Now I don't know if my room is filling with radiation or what to do!\n\nI look around the office real quick to look for snickering co-workers, but everyone is either sitting idle or obviously on other calls.\n\nMe: I'm not sure I understand the nature of the issue or the reason for your call.\n\nCaller: I Googled your company name, and it says you're the #1 experts in microwave technology!\n\nMe: Um, sir?

Or, why they call it a \"burn-in\" test","not_safe_for_work":false,"locked":false,"body":"I used to work on this display/control panel device that, in the field, would be hooked up to a larger system. The larger system provided DC power to it, so we had a lab power supply that could provide a DC voltage to whatever we were testing. Both the voltage and current limit were adjustable and showed up on the PS's display.\n\nThe device I was working on had the display no longer lighting up, but if you shined a flashlight on it or tilted it the right way, you could still see the image, it was just that the backlight was out. It was on a separate power supply circuit, which wasn't a separate board or module in this case. This company actually did component level repairs on the circuit boards, and we had test equipment to facilitate this kind of troubleshooting. \n\nThe backlight was the older fluorescent type which ran on around 500V if I remember correctly. In training, I was told that our multimeters couldn't withstand that voltage. This didn't make sense because both the meters and the probes themselves were rated for up to 1000V, but who knows, my trainer probably found out the hard way that in practice, it couldn't take it.\n\nAs a result, we just replaced both the transformer and the switching transistor at the same time when there was a problem with the backlight not getting power, assuming a known good display did not light up. I had already done that test, so I replaced both of those parts and put the whole device back together.\n\nI plugged it back in and it worked fine. All buttons and controls work, what more do you expect? I left the thing turned on while I filled out the \"paperwork\" or should I say computer work on the device. \n\nAfter I've finished documenting what I did to repair the device, I start to notice a burning smell. I look at all my equipment including the device I just repaired, and everything is still on. Did I leave my soldering iron turned on? Nope, it's off. \n\nI get up from my desk and start looking around for anything that's either smoking or just has the screen flickering. As I walk away, I notice the smell is weaker away from my desk than near it. \n\nThis is weird. Usually, by the time something has started to smell bad, the device in question would have already quit working. So where the heck is this smell coming from? Well, time to start sniffing things more closely.\n\nComputer tower? Nope. Monitor? Nope. Power supply? Nope. My display/control panel? Bingo! \n\nOkay, now to narrow down the source of the smell. Again, we did component level repairs here rather than replacing a board whenever possible. Thankfully, we weren't expected to patch traces that were damaged, however. \n\nIt turns out there are capacitors right next to the transistor that I had to replace, and said capacitors are relatively heat sensitive, so it is easy to break them when soldering near them. In this case, they failed in a rather odd way where they were electrically \"leaky\" that is, they let some amount of current flow through them, causing them to heat up and emit a burnt odor. However, in this case it wasn't enough to actually trigger the overcurrent protection in either the unit itself or the lab power supply. Therefore everything appeared fine except for the burnt smell.\n\nAfter replacing those capacitors everything still worked fine and the smell was gone.\n\nTL;DR: Sometimes even working equipment can emit a burning smell depending on what's wrong with it.\n\nEdit: typo","score":926,"comments":[{"body":"Some years ago I got the zero-lot of a new product, all ten devices.

I am not proud of my time, behaviour or attitude during those years. It was my first job in IT, I was in my mid 20s and the atmosphere of the place was absolutely toxic. We thought we were gods when we were clowns and cowboys.\n\nAll stories are around 15y ago and to the best of my memory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCast will be Me, Customer, his daughter and MyBoss\n\nI'd done jobs for Customer for a while, a good guy and we got on well. I'd been to his home a few times, once spent aaaaaages dicking around trying to set something up that should have been simple but refused to take. Tried to charge him for the work completed and he insisted on paying me for the time taken instead, three times what I'd asked for. \n\nI have this theory that most people, whatever it is they do, are always tweaking and messing with it. Always tinkering, honing their skills, fixing previous mistakes or misconceptions after learning something new. My personal home lab is perpetually 85% complete. And like me Customer's thing was similarly always never quite finished, never just so. Customer though is an architect, his home was his thing. It was beautifully done but have a look around and you'd see bricks and cement stacked up by where the front steps should be, half built. At one point he moved and I asked about all the work he put in to the old place, he said he'd moved his family out temporarily to “build a third floor” on it which is not something I thought you could do. But then again I would never have thought to question it before.\n\nCustomer: “Hi, after I moved house that PC you built for me doesn’t work. It starts booting Windows and then reboots”\n\nMe: “Ok bring it in we’ll have a look”\n\nI stick it on a bench at the shop. It boots first time.\n\nMe: “Seems to be working fine. You moved house yeah? I’ll reseat a few things and screw them back in, sometimes things wiggle loose in transport”\n\nCustomer: “ok thanks, I’ll try again”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCustomer: “I’ve got it back and plugged it all in and it’s doing the same again”\n\nCustomer brings it back to the shop. Again it boots first time. I go through the usual explanation of trying to diagnose intermittent problems and can’t fix what ain’t broke which he accepts. But he does ask me to come up and see it in situ which is fair and I’m happy to do.\n\nI pop up and he’s not in, his daughter answers the door and says dad has said he’ll be home late and just to crack on. I barely recognise her, I’ve not seen her in a while and she’s grown up, must be in her late teens now. I go to his office, boot it up.. and it does exactly what he’s described. POSTs, begins booting Windows, then boot cycles. Damn. I troubleshoot, can’t fix it and don’t drive so leave a message with Customer’s daughter that I’ve seen the issue for myself and to call me.\n\nThe PC ends up back at the shop, I end up back at his home again, the thing even comes back home with me once to see if there’s anything just weird going on that I can observe. And roger a codger the damn thing boots fine every time, except in his office. He takes it back again and calls from home. Understandably he’s frustrated to find it still won’t boot.\n\nCustomer: “Look we’ve been back and forth over this for weeks, it still doesn’t work and I’m getting sick of this”\n\nMe: “Yeah I know, I am really sorry but it just doesn’t have any issues when we try it, but I have seen it happen it’s not as if I don’t believe you”\n\nCustomer: “So what are we going to do about it then?”\n\nMe: “Well, the one common thing about it not booting is when it’s in your office. Can you try it somewhere else in the home, or at your neighbour’s?”\n\nCustomer takes the sharp inhale of breath he’ll need to tell me what he thinks of this suggestion.\n\nMe: “Now, before you say anything I just want you to know that if anyone had ever told me to do what I’ve just asked you to do, I would tell them to GET. F\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*CKED. But it’s the only place it happens and the last thing I have to rule out”\n\nUnhappily, he agrees. No happier but very much more chill, he calls back.\n\nCustomer: “Ok, so I took it to my neighbour’s and tried it an you’re right it boots first time. Sorry for the runaround and all that”\n\nMe: “It’s absolutely fine, I’m just glad we got it sorted out”\n\nCustomer: “Well it gave my wife a good laugh and I’m going to look at the electrical wiring”\n\nMyBoss told me soon after Customer had been back in insisting that we take some payment for the time we put into it, I don’t remember if he accepted or not. I do not ask Customer if by any chance the power socket in the office was one he fitted himself. I also do not ask him how old his daughters are now. It's just that seeing her made me think they must be nearly old enough to be leaving home for university. And the old house is still in progress.

In addition to SLAs for corporate customers, we used to maintain a 24/7 callout roster for phone services that were deemed urgent (emergency services, doctors, people with medical issues etc). It was a regulatory requirement that for every fault report the operators had to ask if there was anybody in the house with a medical condition, but couldn't ask for details due to privacy laws. \\[EDIT: I can't recall the exact wording of the script, but it was along the lines of urgent, serious, significant, life threatening etc\\](important later).\n\nAnyway, its Christmas day. I've just sat down to Christmas lunch (Summer in Australia so the main Christmas gathering for most families) with my extended family visiting from hours away and in-laws visiting from overseas when I get a call about a priority fault. Customer with medical issues on a rural property has phone issues and the linesperson they initially dispatched couldn't find anything wrong.\n\nSo off I go approx. an hour drive (roads are clear though because everyone else is home with their families having lunch) and knock on the door where surprise, surprise I have interrupted their entire extended family having Christmas lunch.\n\nCheck the phone line and it's got dial tone, it's clear, I can call out and call in. Linesperson notes indicate no battery or earth faults and other than being a long run due to being rural, it's a good line.\n\nThen the wife says, ***\"Well why won't the new computer connect to the internet?\"***. Dig a little deeper and it turns out the line is fine but they got the grandkids a computer for Christmas but can't figure out how to set up the PC and modem for dial up internet. (We were not the ISP they were trying to sign up with BTW). So they have called phone faults and logged a fault. ***\"So what is the urgent medical condition?\"***  *I ask, a*nd she replies ***\"Oh my husband has had surgery from scratching his eye on a rose bush and has to wear an eye patch until it heals. They only asked if someone had a medical issue. Not what it was\"***\n\nI explain very firmly that this is not a legitimate call out, that there could have been someone else legitimately in need of help and that the computer or internet connection was never part of their service agreement.  The response is ***\"but we didn't want to disappoint the children on Christmas day\"***. Didn't even have the decency to look embarrassed when I pointed out that they had ruined Christmas day for my family and that of the linesperson that had attended earlier. Then had the gall to ask if I would have a look at the computer anyway \"**S*****ince I was there and didn't want to waste a trip\"***\n\nPolitely declined and because of the regulatory framework we couldn't even charge them for an incorrect call out.

I just came off call today. I work my regular shift 7am - 4pm and then I’m on call from 5pm - 8am from Friday to Friday. I wanted to share a story with you that happened three days ago.\n\nI got a call from our help desk. They are the only people authorized to call the people on call after hours if it’s an emergency. The help desk person called me at 1:30am and woke my ass up to let me know a user was having some wireless connectivity issues. By the way I call our help desk the helpless desk because they don’t even try. They are just ticket creating machines and pass out tickets like your at a horse race placing your bet. \n\nI then asked for the Hostname of the pc so I could get the IP and mac of this ladies laptop. I then asked what site is she currently at. The help desk told me she needed to come into work so she was at the clinic and it was locked and needed to access our wireless network. \n\nShe then told the helpless desk that she was in her car because she doesn’t have a key to unlock the clinic and expected the wifi network to reach out to the parking lot where she was sitting In her car and called in a ticket because she kept getting disconnected. Sigh…. \n\nIf any of you are wondering how I resolved this, I politely told her, “ma’am we guarantee maximum signal strength inside of the clinic” and if you would like to access our secured network you need to be inside of the clinic. \n\nI then reminded her that she is authorized (and I checked her AD account to make sure she was a member of the Citrix VDA remote group) to access our network remotely. We use a 2 factor authentication with google authentication and the google Authenticator. \n\nI checked Citrix Director and she used it not even a week ago. That part boggles my mind as to why she needed to drive to the clinic. I probably should’ve asked her, “ma’am, what specifically can you not do remotely that you have to drive to the clinic to access the network there”. But you know how it is when you get woken up in the middle of the night, lol! She did say she had wifi at home and didn’t make me aware of it not working for her or anything like that. \n\nI walked her through accessing our remote webpage and they sign in with their AD credentials and the Google authenticator key. Bam! She can access our network remotely from home with her home wifi. Damn help desk should have done this for her and walked her through. They are not new to it, and this is a common issue they address because people lock their ad accounts up when they fat finger their keyboards when working remotely and when on site. They also add the groups to ad accounts once remote access is approved for that particular user from their department Director. \n\nWe usually have 1-2 helpdesk representatives after hours, and they work solely at night and that is their normal shift. What pisses me off is because they don’t get a lot of calls. They are allowed to bring a game system or watch Netflix on a laptop. But man, they don’t give two shits about waking you up at night for stuff like this, after you have already worked a full day shift. I guess I was striving for that customer service.

Its 7 pm and I am currently at home in my underwear  because my shift ends at five. But  its an important user, for one of the site critical areas. Lets call him Mike\n\n\"I cant print!\"  Says mike.

Besides, unless there is an active emergency on site I dont get paid overtime. \n\n\"Oh, balls. Well Im already out,  I will take a look at it tomorrow.

They can change your password, reset some security settings and thats all. Anything more complex they raise a ticket, and escalate. However, lately there has been an initiative to give them more powers, in an efford to reduce the dedicated onsite and remote teams in size and cost.  \n\nI arrive next morning to ticket from Mike. Now hes got no network. This is a big fucking problem. Mike works in a critical area, and if his computer cant access the Tato Network, potato orders cant come in, potatoes wont be sent to production, and production chain that produces this delicious golden chips we all live for will come to a halt.  \n\nUsually network connectity problems to the Mr Tato network are straight forward. Not this time. Control panel shows there are no network adapters. They are not deactivated, they are just gone. This is weird.  At the same time I open last night's ticket because for the life of me I cant figure how this happened. \n\nIt turns out the service desk agent, Potatohead, remoted into the user's desktop himself trying to get the printer to work, according to mike. According to the minimal ticket documentation, he changed \"network configuration\" and then tried to reset the network as part of troubleshooting.  Mr Potatohead, what did you do?\n\nKeep checking. Open services. I notice  networking services are stopped. **All of them. In fact, many basic windows services are stopped, and wont start.** Open the list of services that load when windows starts. All normal, windows is set to boot normally. This keeps getting weird. \n\nNext step, check service dependencies. I follow the thread of dependencies upwards and find the culprit. A very basic windows dll failed to start. Description marks it as corrupt or missing. \n\nFor those with fulfilling social lives, this files are vital for windows to work. Multiple components depends on the dlls, and naturally, windows will not simply let you delete, alter or move this files from its folder, system32.  And somehow Mr Potatohead managed to. Somehow potatohead managed to turn what would be a simple five minute fix into a whole day backup, restore and reimage process.  I still have half a mind to hunt him down and ask him how and why he did this, when he should have simply escalated. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The end.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAddenum: As I was writing this I got to thinking, maybe its nor Mr Potatohead's fault.

I am not proud of my time, behaviour or attitude during those years. It was my first job in IT, I was in my mid 20s and the atmosphere of the place was absolutely toxic. We thought we were gods when we were clowns and cowboys.\n\nAll stories are around 15y ago and to the best of my memory. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCast for this is Me, Client, MyBoss and collectively StartupGuys, who I believe were two guys, one StartupGeek one SalesGuy. I spoke almost exclusively with the SalesGuy\n\nClient for this one was a hair and beauty salon. Very nice people. StartupGuys had come to them to offer their product which was a sort of customer history with pictures website. They had a photobooth thing that would add a picture of the customer to their record to review later. I think the idea was the customer would come in weeks or months after their last appointment and find their record, and say they wanted their hair done \"like last time, but with more whatever\".\n\nThe deal between Client and StartupGuys was no money changing hands, but the Client would be their first customer and test case. StartupGuys would use this success to showcase to future clients.\n\nClient asks us to support them getting all this set up on the network. I go down to assess what we're working with. Somewhere there is a server, the photobooth thing, a router and three mini PCs connected to a small touchscreen terminal each, smaller than a sheet of paper with a very wide, deep bezel that stands off the screen by an inch. Making it very hard to get into the edges or corners with a fingertip. Like where the the Start button is, FOR EXAMPLE. The mini PCs have been wedged into the existing furniture, into small wooden drawers that also held the hairdresser's tools of the trade. Covered in hair, sprays/oils/foams etc.\n\nWe went down to look at various things over many visits, over maybe a couple of months. So much of it blurs together now but I'll recall the fun details. MyBoss and I have concluded early on this whole thing is a hopeless mess, but MyBoss thinks it doesn't hurt to make some money off it so nonchalantly gives me the go ahead to assist as needed. This isn't a linear story, more a list of things I encountered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst I think SalesGuy says they've had problems with the network. So I take a seat in front of the touchscreen, raising both my hands out of muscle memory. I pause. Something is wrong. I can't place it immediately. You know when there's just a lapse of cognitive processing in a situation like you've hit a brick wall, but don't know why? Like if someone gave you a PIN for a credit card with a digit too short and your brain simply waits for the universe to make sense?\n\nMe: \"uhhhh....\"\n\nMyBoss: \"Where is keyboard?\"\n\nMe: \"..OSK?\"\n\nMyBoss: \"Where?\"\n\nMe: \"....system32?\"\n\nWe find the on screen keyboard and start getting the StartupGuys network mapped out. Eventually we find their router (in another drawer full of hair and.. sticky) and plug the building LAN into StartupGuys WAN. I'm not 100% sure but I may have also set DHCP up to not match the scope for the building network. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe leave for the day after getting the basics working, getting the odd call now and then to see if we can help. All along MyBoss breezily telling me to give SalesGuys enough to get on with. MyBoss will be milking the situation as far as he can. Weeks into the project SalesGuy calls with another support question.\n\nSalesGuy: \"Can you help with something? We can access our website on the server but not from the terminals\"\n\nMe: \"ok.. it's all behind your router, all on the same network?\"\n\nSalesGuy: \"Yeah but..\"\n\nMe: \"I'll have a look\"\n\nI head to the client. The website is accessible from the terminals but elements are missing.\n\nSalesGuy: \"What does that mean?\"\n\nMe: \"I.. it's your server, your website. I don't know what's wrong with it\"\n\nSalesGuy: \"But why doesn't it work?\"\n\nClient, MyBoss: \"Can you help him?\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not a software person, I don't code, I don't debug, I don't even know if I'm using the right terminology for this (and still don't as I type this up right now)\"\n\nClient, MyBoss: \"Can you just like.. TRY?\"\n\nSeriously? Ok I'll \"try\" to fix something I know absolutely nothing about with all of you hovering over my shoulder ffs I have no idea what I'm supposed to do I hate you I hate it here this is insane wtf am I supposed to do about this ummm rightclick (on the touchscreen, so long press for a rightclick menu), view source I GUESS?? Scroll through StartupGuys webpage HTML maybe?? omg this is awful go away stop staring at me while I work this is impossible why am I doing this where is StartupGeek shouldn't he be doing this omg omg internal scream I want to go home... OH.\n\nVia a series of poker faces, eyeball movements, eyebrow raises and subtle nods, I direct MyBoss to see what I see and gain permission to explain what I have discovered.\n\nMe: \"You can't use a href=\"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\....\" on a website, unless you're viewing it from the server. It's pointing at it's own C: drive. On any other PC it will be looking in that computer's own C:, not your C:\"\n\nSalesGuy: \"...\"\n\nMe: \"Tell StartupGeek to figure out remote vs local file storage and links\"\n\nI gave him some extra help with this. But to give you an idea of how useless we all were at this I think I told him to use \\\\\\\\fileshare\\\\path. I can't remember now, but they managed to get it working with the local/remote nudge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think it's now getting on to a month since this whole thing started and it's still not workable. Double NAT and port forwarding is explained. And configured for them, naturally. As this is not our project we are treating it more as an amusing circus show. At this point however, I actually start to see what shape it's all going to take.\n\nMe: \"So.. The customer just searches for themselves to bring up their details?\"\n\nSalesGuy: \"Yup! Simples!\"\n\nMe: \"Where do they log in?\"\n\nSalesGuy: \"They don't need to\"\n\nMe: \"But how do they access their unique profile and bring up all their hist... oh... with the pictures and everything?\"\n\nSalesGuy: \"Yep!\"\n\nMe: \"Accessible online?\"\n\nSalesGuy: \"Yeah!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe project was eventually abandoned, Client didn't want to spend any more time on it. Or money, we were offered all of the equipment in lieu of payment which MyBoss agreed to. So we pack up a few bags of greasy kit caked in human hair. The \"server\" we found out was an XP PC in a thin case, those half height PCI bracket ones locked in the base of the photobooth cabinet.

They threatened us with non-compliance fines if we didn't have it done ASAP.\n\nGetting electronics updated during the middle of a global supply shortage thanks to COVID was no cake walk (and still isn't), but we managed to upgrade all of our workshop programming tablets and the manufacturer left content.\n\nFast forward to two months ago, this manufacturer issues a recall notice for one of their cars.  As part of the recall, they demand a sound recording for the warranty case.  They supplied the workshops with microphones to plug into the tablets to record whatever sounds they need.  Problem is, they supplied microphones with 3.5MM jacks.  Like most modern electronics, the new tablets don't have onboard 3.5MM jacks.\n\nAha, I hear most of you say, why don't you just use a Bluetooth adapter, or a USB-C to 3.5MM jack adapter?  \n\nWell, the manufacturer thought of this.  The software they use for this recall checks what model tablet you have when you open it.  If you don't have a tablet that's on their \"authorised device list\" (among other requirements, a tablet with an onboard 3.5MM jack), it will refuse to run, adapter or not.  \n\nThe really insane thing was that the tablets we have from the beginning of the year were Samsung SM-T876B's, yet one of the authorised devices on their list was Samsung SM-T870 which is the same model as far as I can tell just with slight differences.  Still won't work thanks to the model number difference.\n\nAfter trying to get this company to understand the problem but failing miserably, I had to go dig through the tech junk pile.  Like a lot of IT people, I have a pile of stuff that is obsolete but still works fine and kept 'just in case'.\n\nI came up with a few older SM-P600's, which amazingly were on their authorised list. Fired them up to make sure they were working and sent them to the service departments. So now our service departments are running tablets with the latest version of Android alongside one tablet running Android 5 for warranty purposes.  The problem I have now is that each service department has only one of these warranty tablets.  If it fails or dies, I can't replace it.\n\nI'm contemplating joining the Amish.\n\n\nEDIT:  A few people keep asking this question.  None of the model numbers on the authorised list were upgrades from the tablets rolled out at the beginning of the year.  They were mostly all downgrades, the only reason they were on the list was because they were older models with onboard 3.5MM jacks.","score":1368,"comments":[{"body":"I had a client where the CIO was laying out his strategic direction for the coming year.

MyBoss has been down on the Friday, Saturday, Monday and Tuesday to show his face and look involved.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMyBoss: \"They can't access their CRM thingy, it's not our problem. The DBGuys from the place that built it for them say it's a network issue but I can ping the server and that's fine, it's a database problem. Just go and have a look for appearances sake and we can say we're sparing no effort to look at it\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk, off I go with the customary amount of required information to achieve my goal, easy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: \"Hi everyone, so just for fun lets start from the beginning for my sake, just tell me what's going on please?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClientSecretaries: \"We can't access anything on the system, we can't see any of the appointments or make new ones\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClientBoss: \"I'm going spare, please do what you can anything please. I've got the DBGuys down here looking at it too and they're convinced it's a network issue\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClientBoss is AGITATE. I get the picture. For anonymity no details, but this guy's business is expensive rates for well off clients for bookings from an hour to a half day. All the shiny suits who spend their bank holidays in a polo shirt and shorts washing their Audi, and their trophy wives, spend a lot of money for relatively short appointments. Anything less than perfect service is an embarassment. Client has no way of keeping track of who and when and what, they don't even know how much business they're losing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: \"Ok, so let's try a few things\" tries ping from reception PC to server, works fine \"and it's the same for all of you?\" my one/many/all question, who is this affecting? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClientSecretaries: \"We can't get on but they can up in the office\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWut. Well this is new. MyBoss had not mentioned this. Around this point I see the DBGuys. We are not introduced, ClientBoss is too distracted for anything like that. But the air has changed. The situation is not as described. My professional survival instincts and ego silently exchange places. DBGuys and I do not make direct eye contact but the sense of us versus them is tangible. They are onsite, I am beginning to understand, after a GET HERE NOW type phone call from ClientBoss, and heads will roll today. We both glance at each other through our peripheral vision. We both know, and know they know, and know they know we know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: \"Righty ho then, let's have a look\" sure enough PCs in the office work fine. The server is in the office. Huh. \"I'm just going to start tracing what's going on, thanks\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy trace is I trace the cables. The reception PCs connect to a simple 8 port 10/100 switch which in turn connect to another simple 8 port switch in the office. Which we almost certainly sold them. For those who know, it's a Netgear. The white ones, not the blue ones. And I see it. Oh teh noes, I see it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: \"So when did this start?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClientSecretaries: \"After the powercut\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen everything lost power. Oh teh noes. That would explain why the port on the cheap consumer grade switch connecting to the reception switch is lit orange instead of green. They've negotiated the link at 10mbs not 100mbs. More than enough for some simple ping packets, but not for their client management system. Oh teh noes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: \"I'm just going to make a quick call\" - OUTSIDE.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: \"blah blah blah\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMyBoss: \"oh...\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: \"so the fix is to powercycle it, ClientBoss has no idea about tech but he knows what turn it off and on again means..\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMyBoss: \"Can you just.. \\*try\\* it?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: \"umm.. well do or do not really isn't it? There is no \\*try\\*\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMyBoss: \"ok do it and do your best\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks. Really, Thank you MyBoss. So off I go, powercycle a switch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: \"Can you try it now please?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClientSecretaries: \"Oh yeah it's working now!!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClientBoss has overheard this. DBGuys almost certainly have too. ClientBoss skips over with a hesitant but growing smile. Given the situation I can only see his face as a hideous maelstrom of panic and hope fighting for dominance and I am the face this face will question.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClientBoss: \"Is it working??\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: \"Seems so now, yes\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClientBoss \"....What was wrong with it??\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEvery human who was once ever a child will recall a time a parent or teacher asks a question in a certain tone of voice. Every human who was once ever a child will recall that sensation of having fleeting nanoseconds to offer an answer that will be plausible and innocent enough to avoid BIG. TROUBLE. God's own atomic clock was ticking for me. I had nothing. I had absolutely nothing. Nothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I've resynchronised your switch, ClientBoss\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWho tf said that? omg it was me, what is happening?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClientBoss: \"...\" \\*non-comprehending head spasm, terrifying look of mad glee\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"One side of your switch was communicating with the other side of your switch at a different speed\", I offer some hand gestures so represent something being higher than the other \"so I've resyncronised it so they can talk together properly\" bring my hands level and tap my fingertips together \"and that seems to have fixed it\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe being within me that emerges only to protect us in times of mortal peril rests now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClientBoss: \"...but it's working now, yeah?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI simply smile and nod. I've learned in my career sometimes people don't want the techy gibberish. They want to see your confidence. They can offload their fears if you look like you know what you're doing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClientBoss, grinning: \"ok I'll tell these DBGuys they can go home, cheers!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI take my leave instantly, before I burst out laughing. I get back to the shop for a debrief. MyBoss's pride is wounded, but we've gotten away with it. It's nearly closing time, my giggles and adrenaline subside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen the phone rings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe caller ID I recognise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: \"Hi..

A pause. omg this is is awful please let this end.... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClientBoss: \"THANK YOU, Me. Thank.

(This’ll teach you to ask for more!)\n\nI was asked to share more stories so I figured I would throw another one out there. Here is what you need to know if you are just joining. I worked at a larger tech company as a build engineer. The company did not follow best practices and the managers were/are in way over their heads. This is the story of the first red flag project from my Team Lead. I supported hundreds of Devs and projects.\n\nThe actors are the Clown (AKA Team Lead), Other Engineer, Junior Engineer.\n\nSo the previous Build Engineer Lead bailed and left me and my colleagues there to pick up the pieces. He was nice and professional about it (and I do keep in touch with him).\n\nThe team was restructured and I was transferred there since I was already writing code to help with the builds and database deployments. Soon Clown is hired as Lead (from off the street). Other Engineer was also hired on shortly after.\n\nClown suggested we set up an artifact repository and use Maven conventions so we can be consistent (That is an important/relevant detail). This is a good move for us. At this point Clown has my trust. He has a good resume and does a decent job of BSing with the right tech jargon. The management is dazzled. The team is in need of direction, resources, and expertise so nothing to suggest there are any issues.\n\nWe test out 2 repo softwares and then pick one. Other Engineer is responsible for setting up and configuring the production version. There are a fair number of barriers to set this up. Contact IT to get servers, Security to get firewall allowances, Security to ensure software is legit, Accounting to pay for the license, and so on. All of this is normal corporate BS.\n\nOther Engineer and I are working together every day to set this thing up. Clown is calling the shots when we have questions and helping interface with other departments. A good dynamic.\n\n(𝅘𝅥𝅮Start Montage Music𝅘𝅥𝅮)\n\n\\[Clown\\] Be sure to install the java plugin so that it can talk to the database…\n\n\\[Other Engineer\\] Which version of the plugin should we use?\n\n\\[Me\\] This version is the latest stable version supported by the DB.\n\n\\[Clown\\] Yup let’s use that.\n\n\\[Other Engineer and Me\\] Okay! (We happily jump back to the setup)\n\n\\[Me\\] IT is having issues getting these settings right…\n\n\\[Clown\\] Sure, let me go chat with them and we can get that server up by the end of day.\n\n(𝅘𝅥𝅮End Montage Music𝅘𝅥𝅮)\n\nIt was all going well. Easy decisions and flow states all around. We would run into an issue or pushback from a department then Clown would ease things along. (I think he legit tries to be decent human he just has a bad nature but so do all well written villains)\n\n\\[Me\\] We are done. Software is in place and build artifacts are now going to the repo and being picked up by the deployment software.\n\n\\[Other Engineer\\] F\\* yeah, that took weeks, but worth it.\n\n\\[Junior Engineer\\] Excuse me guys, we have builds failing…\n\nSo Other Engineer and I look over the builds and figure out that the builds are not failing, but the upload to the artifact repo is failing. You can’t use the same name for a package that has a different hash.\n\n\\[Other Engineer and Me\\] Yup it’s the file name. (We report this to Clown)\n\n\\[Clown\\] Aren’t you familiar with Maven? Just use Maven conventions.\n\n\\[Other Engineer\\] Well we are using the naming conventions you gave us (it was not Maven convention), but as long as we are using the build number this way we will have name collisions. Those collisions break the builds and deployments.\n\n\\[Clown\\] Those will go away as soon as we have enough builds…\n\n\\[Me\\] Well kind of… Every time we create a new branch the build numbers reset for that branch so … we will forever have collisions… I mean it is just how the math works…\n\n\\[Other Engineer\\] We can add something like a hash to make each branch’s artifact unique that would fix it.\n\n\\[Clown\\] You guys clearly don’t understand how Maven works. This will sort itself out. (He dismisses us with no solution or guidance)\n\nSo we re-ran broken builds constantly for weeks hoping the situation would fix itself. I mean the math did not work (See Diagram). Other Engineer and I both came to this conclusion.\n\n\\[Junior Dev\\] We are still having collisions on a regular basis. Devs are pretty pissed their builds are taking 2-3 times longer than they used to. We have tons of tickets on this.\n\n\\[Me\\] Well the build numbers are causing a collision. We have to manually run the builds a few times until we get a unique build number.\n\n\\[Junior Engineer\\] Can’t we just fix the number?\n\n\\[Me\\](realizing if it is just a parameter I can alter it) … Yes we can…\n\nSo I sat down with Other Engineer and we decided to bump and stagger numbers on different build branches. Silence. No breaking builds. Everything is working now… collisions are still possible (but way less frequent). So for the next couple of weeks to solve the issue of collisions we manually bump the build number by some arbitrary magnitude. That works for our team until Clown gets a collision ticket.\n\n\\[Junior Engineer\\] Yeah, just bump the numbers up.\n\n\\[Clown\\] NO! That’s not how MAVEN works!\n\n\\[Junior Engineer\\] But that’s how we have been fixing it for weeks.\n\n\\[Clown\\] Who told you to do that?\n\n\\[Me\\] I did.\n\n\\[Clown\\] (To me) You don’t know how Maven works.\n\n\\[Me\\] The build number does not affect the minor version. We are just skipping re-running the builds a bunch of times and advancing the number manually to avoid future collisions.\n\n\\[Clown\\] NO! That’s not how this works! We will not be bumping numbers any more! You will use the build numbers and rerun the builds until it sorts itself out.\n\n\\[Me\\] Very well. For the record this will not work and we will forever have collisions if we do that. The vendor has documentation on how to deal with this issue.\n\nClown dismisses my input (really should have seen that as foreshadowing for his later jackassery). We re-run builds every now and then because the projects with a number bump would only hold so long until other builds caught up…\n\nFast forward a year. A deployment failed on a high visibility new project. Our department supervisor and other Team Leads are breathing down my neck (literally at my desk behind me) as I rerun a broken build tons of times. I explain the build is fine, the code is fine, the artifact is fine, the artifact repo is working. The artifact is failing from collision issues. I calmly point them to Clown and explain his non-conventional interpretation of “Maven” is responsible for intermittent deployment outage and version goof ups for the last year. I show them the year’s worth of tickets we did to keep it running following his solution. I show them how to easily fix it permanently. I show them the best practices docs from the vendors and explain how we are not following them. (I got my own team soon after and did not get to see that change come about.)\n\nI also ran a quick numbers calc infront of everyone to point out how much this foolishness cost us. (number of tickets \\* average time on ticket \\* cost of an engineer per hour =  $ spent on needless work) They did not like the results. I did also note that did not include delays affecting other departments.\n\nYou could have heard a pin drop in Clown’s cubicle. (Please see the previous post to understand why I am keen to do damage control on him at this point.)\n\nDiagram :\n\nYes it is a hacky solution for artifact naming. No, I am not proud. I had to work with what I was given. There was a hot shower and crying sessions for sure. So much shame. These hands are so dirty….\n\nProject X\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_Main Branch\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_B1\\_\\_B2\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_B3\\_ …\\_B4\n\n\\- \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* \\\\ \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\\\\\_\\\\\\_\\_\\_\\_Feature 2\\_\\_/\\_\\_\\_\\_/   \\\\\\_\\_Feature\\_3\\_\\_/ \\*\\* /\n\n\\-\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* \\\\ \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*  \\\\\\_\\_Hotfix\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_/ \\*\\*\\*\\*\\* \\\\\\_Feature\\_4\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_/\n\n\\-\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\\\\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_Feature 1\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nFeature 1 builds will collide with hotfix, feature 2, 3, and 4\n\nFeature 2 and Hotfix will collide\n\nFeature 4 will collide with feature 3\n\nAll of these will collide with main branch builds\n\nMath of solution:\n\nSo if you add +100 to main you can use build numbers up to 100 on new branches then you will see collisions with Main. So a long branch like Feature 1 would get a large bump (10,000) once it hit 100 so it does not interfere with hotfixes and features or a main branch.  Feature 4 would get a bump of something like 50 to not collide with feature 3.\n\nSo Main Branch is 100 - infinity\n\nFeature 1 is 10,000 to infinity (yes it collides with Main WAY… out at 10,000+)\n\nFeature 2 and Hotfix would usually just collide build numbers are 1-100\n\nFeature 3 uses build number 1-50\n\nFeature 4 uses build number 51 -99\n\nNew major/minor version resets the count so that is how we could reuse 1-100 on new feature branches.\n\nTL:DR\n\nWe added an artifact repository to our build system. This had a constraint of unique names for each artifact. My boss created some weird take on Maven artifact naming conventions that resulted in errors because of the aforementioned constraint. Resulting in massive slowdowns, weird workarounds. Our team came up with a permanent solution from the vendor that he refused to use. The issue festered until a large project came along where it caused an issue and he was outed as a fool.\n\nPrevious Post:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/y7rhn8/how\\_to\\_break\\_all\\_the\\_builds/](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/y7rhn8/how_to_break_all_the_builds/)","score":85,"comments":[{"body":"Long buildup with anticlimatic end.

So far so good.\n\nWe had a little adapter that allowed us to measure the\ncurrent going to and from the battery, as we were\nchecking for any parasitic current draw that might\notherwise discharge the battery (which would necessitate\nmore frequent recharging, thereby shortening it's\nservice life) as well as testing the charging circuit. So,\nI hooked up said adapter to make sure it wasn't a \nboard fault that killed the battery. I then hooked up a \nknown good battery, and rather than begin charging the\nbattery, the DVR is *drawing* about 0.25 A *from* the\nbattery while the DVR is plugged into main power.\n\nWatt?\n\nI shut down the 12V input to the DVR, and it hard-stops\nimmediately as though it lost all power. So where is that\n0.25 A going? Certainly not where it should be going. \nI look at the schematic and try to work out what might\ndraw a small current like that if it failed. Searching for \na hot component probably wouldn't work, because \n0.25 A wouldn't create a noticeable amount of heat.\nHowever, if there's an intermittent problem, pressing\non the board might yield results.\n\nOn a 12 Volt system with a relatively low current draw,\nit is pretty safe for you to touch it with your finger: Of\ncourse, you must ground yourself before doing so,\nlest you break something with static electricity. So\nI put on my anti-static wrist strap and start randomly\npressing my finger against components while watching\nthe meters and... OUCH! Well, that chip is BOILING HOT,\nso it is probably broken. Well, that wasn't too hard. Weird\nthat the current draw is almost normal, save for the \n0.25 A from the battery. So, I circle the chip on the\nschematic so that I remember which part to replace.\nI then reach over to pick up the battery and OUCH! The \nbattery is *also* BOILING HOT! ZOMGWTFBBQ\n\nImmediately I realize that any kind battery being \ntoo hot to touch is a VERY bad thing, and disconnect\nit in a hurry, then rushing to turn off everything on the\nbench. I scan the area surrounding the battery for\nany paper or other flammable materials that need to\nbe moved away from it. There weren't any, except that\nthe table was made of wood. So I grabbed a metal\nbaking pan we had nearby and put it over the battery.\nI thought of putting the battery on the pan, and/or\ntossing it in the freezer, but I didn't think it was wise\nto move it for fear that handling it might set it off.\n\nI mentally reminded myself of where the fire extinguisher\nhad been, and, suppressing my urge to sprint, instead\nwalked over there just to make sure it was still there.\nThankfully, it was right where it belonged. I decide not\nto pick it up, lest I panic anyone when there isn't even\nany smoke coming out, much less flames. Instead I went\nback to the bench and stood several feet away, watching\nand listening for any signs of an imminent fire.\n\nAfter a few minutes the battery had cooled down. Whew!\nHowever, 0.25 A was well within the normal operating\nrange of the battery. Even if it wasn't, there's no way\non Earth anything could create that kind of heat at\nthat voltage without drawing at least 10 times that\namount of current: at least, not without actually\nusing the battery to literally ignite pyrotechnics. \nSomething just wasn't adding up here, which made\nme suspect a problem with the multimeter.\n\nSure enough, if I used the constant current mode on\nthe bench power supply (making a mental note NOT to\nexceed the maximum safe current for the amps\njacks on the multimeter) I discovered that the\n\"auto ranging\" multimeter was apparently \"stuck\"\nat the low end of the amps measurement mode.\nStrangely enough, once you exceeded 0.25A, the meter\ndid not say \"O.L.\" like it was supposed to, it would just\nstop rising, making you believe you were only drawing\n0.25 A even if you were actually drawing much more\nthan that. Yet, the fact that the current meter still changed\nwhen you connected something, would fool you into\nbelieving that the meter was still working properly.\nThe way I could tell is that the bench power supply\nhad a current meter of it's own, and I could crank\nit up to 3 amps and the meter would just sit there, still\nshowing 0.25 amps. (The meter's maximum was 10 amps,\nand it was protected by a fuse)\n\nGiven that not knowing you are overcurrenting a battery\ncould be rather dangerous, I removed the fuse for the\ncurrent measurement jack AND put a note on top\nstating that the current measurement mode did\nnot work. \n\nI later found that the battery in question had a PTC\nbuilt into it. A PTC is sort of like a circuit breaker, though\nit \"resets\" by letting it cool rather than having to \npress a reset button. It \"trips\" when it gets hot, but\nit only reduces the current rather than cutting it off.\nSo the battery just gets relatively hot, but not enough\nto be dangerous, and just dumps current into the \nfault until it runs out and dies. \n\nTL;DR: A working multimeter would have been the bomb","score":239,"comments":[{"body":"&gt; TL;DR: A working multimeter would have been the bomb\n\nOr, in this case, would have helped you *detect* the bomb.","score":69,"comments":[{"body":"Wasn’t that the pun?","score":10,"comments":[]}]},{"body":"[0.25A - not great, not terrible.](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8162428/characters/nm0873744)","score":43,"comments":[{"body":"Goddamnit, you got there first.","score":8,"comments":[{"body":"","score":0,"comments":[]}]}]},{"body":"You ram into what took severely screwed things up in both the movie Jurassic Park and the actual Chernobyl - if the thing you're using to measure something has a maximum value there is no way you are seeing the actual problem.\n\nFor J.P. it was \"once the count reached 100, we're good. \"Set the count to 500, just for shits and giggles\".

My team supported hundreds of dev teams. Each team is of course on a deadline to get their project compiled, packaged, and deployed to their testing environment.\n\nThis is a system that took a team of 10 engineers months to put together. The actors are the Team Lead we will call him Clown, New Guy, Grumpy Engineer, and Other Engineer.\n\nSo we get a request to make a large change that will affect all projects. So Clown announces the new project in stand up to impress the New Guy. He gives some BS about how it will work and so on. Then we finish the stand up and get to work.\n\nClown swings by my cube to let me know I will be doing the updates.\n\n\\[Clown\\] You need to roll this change out. (Loud enough to let the team know he is showing off to New Guy)\n\n\\[Me\\] Sure but that will take a couple of weeks to implement on all projects. We can focus on the high priority projects first.\n\n\\[Clown\\] This should take a few hours tops!\n\n\\[Me\\] Well the changes are not hard but we have to test each build. If the project breaks we will have to roll it back on that build plan. Not to mention the deployments to the test environment will be delayed...\n\n\\[Grumpy and Other Engineer\\] (Lean out and look worried at me...)\n\n\\[Clown\\] BS I can have it done in an afternoon.\n\nClown storms off to his foolish meetings and I go back to working the tickets I have.\n\nNext morning. Clown starts off the meeting with a smile like the cat that ate the canary. We each go over what we are working on and what we did. Then at the end he says his bit.\n\n\\[Clown\\] ... Oh and I did the ticket you said would take weeks last afternoon. It took me an hour!\n\n\\[New Guy\\] Impressive!\n\n\\[Me, Grumpy and Other Engineer\\] (shock dawning on us)\n\n\\[Me\\] WHAT!!! Did you test them all?\n\n\\[Clown\\] No... it worked on the one I did so I rolled it out to all the projects.\n\n\\[Me\\] Why did you do that I said they have to be tested...\n\n\\[Other Engineer\\] Oh sh!t...\n\n\\[Grumpy Engineer\\] ...\n\nClown is pissed because I called him out. On making untested changes to the build system (resulting in the 2nd largest breaking change in the company's tech history). We leave stand up and sit down. Our queue of tickets (usually 3-4) is full hundreds of tickets.\n\n\\[Grumpy Engineer\\] All the deployments are f\\*ed ... Release day is tomorrow. No code is going out!\n\n\\[Me\\] We are screwed this will take weeks to clean up. All because you wouldn't wait and listen. (I yell loud enough to let Clown know he screwed us.)\n\nClown is silent as reality dawns on him. New Guy is in panic mode his boss just screwed up big enough that the dev department head is sitting in Clown's cube asking him WTF. He won't leave until his builds are fixed. Other Engineer leans over and explains what Clown did, what I suggested, and how long it will take to fix.\n\nNext morning. Clown is terse in the standup. I sit down and get to work cleaning up his mess. We release the code and move on. Until I get a call. The wrong code is on production.\n\n\\[Me\\] How? Why?\n\nThe buggy build software has a audit log and there it is clear as day, Clown changed the build and the wrong branch is being checked out and deploying. He has hosed the entire setup. Trying to cover up his trail.\n\nOur team spent months finding and fixing all the crap he broke from just this incident.\n\nThat folks is how you break all the builds at an enterprise level.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: We needed to update our builds. I say we need to test the changes. Clown Team Lead cowboys the change out and did not properly test it. The change breaks hundreds of builds. He breaks everything further trying to fix it and deploys the wrong code to production.

I was an intern with their Network Support team. This was not an IP network team like you might be thinking, but rather a PoTS network team. We were supporting analog phone lines going between various sites; office buildings, power plants, etc. So pictures a bunch of guys who have been dealing with the same kind of equipment for \\~25 years each. Very knowledgeable about what they knew, but not so much on newer stuff.\n\nThey had a bunch of techs going out to all of these sites, making updates to wiring or equipment, and coming back to our dispatch center. Now having all of these techs doing jobs like this, you'd imagine that there should be some kind of logging mechanism for all of the jobs being done, so that when something went wrong at Site A, you could look at everything that's been done there in the past 6 months, and look at where all the cables are connected to. You'd be right. In our case, the \"single source of truth\" for this information was an excel workbook on a networked storage drive that all of the techs had access to. Mind you, this was not a well-structured workbook with sheets per-location and tables of jobs done. This was essentially a freeform document with a single sheet, thousands of rows, and structure per-site or no structure at all in some cases. It was essentially a word document that just so happened to be addressable with row and column numbers (in some cases). Now even \\_if\\_ this were a well-structured document, using an excel doc on a NAS is a really bad collaboration tool. At the time (I'm not sure if this is true today), excel used lockfiles to ensure that only one person could update a workbook at a time. This meant that when you opened the workbook while someone else had it open on their own machine, you'd get a prompt that told you you had to open it in read-only mode, or you could save a separate copy. Many times techs chose to save a separate copy, meaning that there would often be many copies of this file that would later need to be merged. Since this document had essentially no structure, it was impossible to programmatically diff two versions of it, so all merging needed to be done by hand. I tried to convince management that we needed some kind of job management/log software instead of this terrible system, but they were unmoved. I was told the existing system was good enough and to just deal with it. Besides, I was just an intern fresh out of HS.

Point out something quite complex that she recently learned/ taught herself how to do and add a few details that highlight something tricky about it. Like learning a language or something similar. \"You took the time to nail this challenging thing but you seem to have decided that you're absolutely incapable of learning anything when it comes to tech.\" (you are calling out that she has *decided* to be helpless)\n\n\"You are one of the smartest and most capable people I've ever known so I'm seriously concerned about this behavior.\"\n\nShe'll then make the same excuses you've heard a million times so be prepared to use those Exact Same Excuses on the thing you've just praised her learning. \"How did you learn that complex dance routine? Did you give up as soon as the instructor walked you through it saying \"it was too complex\" and just decide you couldn't possibly learn it? Then why are you doing the same with anything that has a computer chip in it?\" (using her own \"i just can't\" words and logic but applying it to her dancing)\n\nIt's going to be an uncomfortable conversation because you are calling out a bad behavior pattern. That's never a fun conversation regardless of who or what. BUT if she's as smart and inquisitive as you make her out to be, that tends to go hand in hand with self awareness to some degree. She's just turned it off on this subject. You're flicking the light on and not letting her get away with throwing her hands in the air and wailing that it's \"too complicated.\"\n\n\"So is dancing when you expect to be step-perfect after watching your instructor run through it once, rather than learning a small piece of it then learning the next step and then the next.

NEVER DO FREE TECH SUPPORT.\n\nWell guys, I took things a step further. I recently finished a CompSci degree and with opportunities few and far between in my country, I was itching for a real-world project I could sink my teeth into from start to finish, for the experience ya know.\n\nOne day, I was chatting with my friend who had just quit her private school teaching job due to burnout and was tutoring students in private classes as a means of income. This particular day she was describing how stressed she was trying to figure out what each parent owed her for the classes (she bills at the start of every quarter). I asked about her process and she showed me an incredibly convoluted spreadsheet (with no formulae) and was doing manual calculations on everything, then contacting each parent with a generic \"you owe me x total\" either by email or text message.\n\nHa! I found my project. I didn't tell her this, but I started working on something quietly. I had a copy of her spreadsheet and in a few months of nights and weekends, much head-bashing, several screwups, and a few tears,  I had a working prototype. At this point I let her know. She was thrilled. Thanked me profusely and promptly left the country she lived in for a couple of months. At this point, I must note that we live on opposite sides of the planet with a 12hr time difference between us. During this time she was online like normal and I asked her to let me know when she was ready to install the application so we could do some testing *before* it was time to use it for real. No dice.\n\nI didn't want to be pushy because what if she didn't actually want this? It's not like I told her I was doing it ahead of time or anything (mainly because I wasn't sure if I could actually produce something good enough). Anyway, two months roll by and she is back in the country that she lives in and is ready and excited about installation. Great. Through much teeth gnashing, we get it installed and she starts using it. I fully expect bugs because while I did extended testing myself, I'm not the user and we all know how that goes! So I ask her to note bugs found in a shared document. By this time, her classes are starting and she is using it with live data and not using any backup note-taking. I try to tell her, \"hey we haven't tested this fully yet, maybe do both for a bit\" but of course, it's too much work. You know what else is too much work, using the very short manual I typed out telling her how each part of the program works.\n\nMuch to my surprise, there are very few bugs. But I look at the document she is compiling and guys there are THIRTY-EIGHT \"Hey maybe you can do this extremely complicated thing to the program so I can only click one button instead of two\".  At first, I considered this good feedback. I mean, if I'm to deal with real-world users, this is *precisely* how they will behave right? I go through the app and fix/change 18 of the 38 things she wanted done. Some I decided were too complicated to accomplish with very little reward, others couldn't really be done because I hemmed myself in with my DB design (learning my lessons!), and some I just found annoying so I defiantly and tactfully said \"no\".\n\nTwo weeks later, I send her version 1.1.  Immediately she complains that the discount field is a percentage value and not a dollar amount. I snarkily comment at any dollar amount is a percentage of a whole. She responds \"I don't know what percentage $100 is of a $900 bill. Well, I guess I could use a calculator. \" (Note: I may actually change the discount field to a dollar amount but I was tired of her entitlement for all the other stuff she requested hence the snark).\n\nToday I woke up to a new note: \"You know what I really hate, having to email out these invoices. Maybe you could make the app do it automatically.\" **Edit to add**: How could I forget that she wanted the email feature done \"in the next couple of days\" so that she could send out invoices before her students start!\n\nGuys, this lady had been manually tracking students, parents, dates, times, contact info, discounts, class attendance, and then sitting with a calculator doing manual calculations etc. I gave her an application that automatically generates nicely designed PDF invoices by the parent based on enrollment of multiple children, keeps track of attendance and payments, maps parents to students, and generates charts, lists, and reports based on provided criteria for both finance (outstanding invoices, income reports for taxes, etc) and enrollment, but how dare I make her manually send out her 10-15 invoices every quarter!\n\nThis was supposed to be a hobby project that I'd work on for a bit, sharpen some skills then move on to working on skills in other areas. I haven't been able to move on from it yet a whole year later because I was dumb and did it for free.\n\nEntirely my fault and I own it. Head, meet desk. Repeatedly.\n\nP.S. I know that such programs already exist and she could easily have found a paid solution online. The goal of the exercise was to see if I could create one from start to finish.

None of these metrics are comparable, substracting or averaging makes zero sense.. Eg they take the amount of stock a company has, look at the median price of the items, multiply them with each other and call it 'unrealized potential', disregarding that a) not the entire price is profit, b) a huge part of that stock is already sold and just being processed, c) number of items times median price does not equal total value.. and d) if they wanted to know the monetary value of the total stock, that's a single query which we could easily provide if someone ever bothered to ask. \n\nAnd then when their metric doesn't align with reality, we're the one getting blamed for 'bad methodology'.

This lady was my 2nd call ever, and it appeared an easy ticket as she just needed her password reset... little did I know.\n\nSo I pull up Office admin page to change password and select change password on next login. I call the client to tell her I reset the password and that she can go ahead and try to login now with the new password and reset it on login. When she puts in the new password she gets a failed to authenticate user error. I become a little flustered as this is supposed to be my easiest task and I screwed up out of the gate. \n\nSo I look over in a slight panic at my team member who has been training me and he fills me in that since they are on a MacBook I am unable to use the change password on first login with office. I try to explain this as I am having it explained to me and she is not having any of it. \"What do you mean, I have used apple for over 10 years and always been able to reset my password.\" Continue to try and explain to her that it isn't a big deal she just needs to tell me what she wants her password to be... Silence... \n\n\"I AM NOT DOING THAT\" \n\nReset her password without the change at login selectef to just a temp password so she can login to her email on her MacBook. But she attempts to login to her email on her phone and now she can't get into her work email on her phone. She can login through the browser on her phone but not her native iphone email app. And she is pissed that she can't set her own password and does not accept that the apple os is having issues (maybe our Tier 3 is wrong but he took the time to give me a satisfactory answer, she just didn't accept it, my doubts lie with her not his explanation) and thinks they as the user should have admin privileges to do password resets and none of this would be an issue.\n\nI tell her I will have to consult with some of my colleagues and will call her back when we have a resolution. I consult with our tier 3 at this point explaining that she won't say the password she wants set so he advises to do a remote connection and login to the admin page on a private browser through her machine and have her enter the password so it is never in plaintext since that seems to be her concern, and tell her to try using the outlook app for mail on her phone. He didn't really have time to elaborate on the phone but didn't think he needed to as Outlook app was the easy answer. \n\nCall the client back to make her aware of what we think will help. She tells me very firmly, she is using the outlook app, and that she even wiped the cache to clear user info and still couldn't login. I try to confirm that she is using Outlook app from the iPhone app store. She says yes she keeps selecting outlook.com at the login page. My team member was monitoring the call at this point and looks at me wildly shaking his head NO. I am not familiar with iPhone, not really my job to be as we don't offer support to mobile devices but we have to make a \"best effort\" to resolve the issue for the client. So he explains that she is using the native Mail app for iPhone and she needs to download Outlook for security reasons when accessing her work outlook account. \n\nI try explaining to no avail and at this point she is just downright belligerent because I have admitted I am not an iPhone user and we don't have a way to remote to her phone so I can offer better support. I pass her off to my team member because he explains to her he uses an iPhone and he was able to login to her email through his phone on the outlook app but not the native mail app and that it seems like her only solution is to use outlook app. She tells him we need to figure this out and it is unacceptable and it's clearly a Microsoft issue (we are not microsoft) so figure it out. He repeats the issue is the iPhone app not the outlook app and she can take the fix or not but we have provided support to the best of our ability and we will be closing this ticket.\n\n\nThat was exhausting to retype/live so if you read all of that please tell me they won't all be like that because even my team member wanted to kick this lady off a bridge to a shallow creek😂","score":227,"comments":[{"body":"They won't all be like that.\nA good sized chunk will, though.
