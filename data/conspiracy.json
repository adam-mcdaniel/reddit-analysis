According to Kutcher, he was late for the date. When he arrived at her house he knocked and no one answered the door. He looked through the window and saw what he thought was wine spilled on the floor and decided to leave.**\n\n**Ellerin had been murdered and received 47 stab wounds. Kutcher had been questioned by law enforcement but no investigation was done they took his story as fact and let him go.**\n\n**The \"Hollywood Ripper\" Michael Garguilo was found guilty of the murder in 2019. Is it possible that Kutcher committed the murder and Garguilo was the patsy? Kutcher has ties to Human Trafficking and to the CIA according to well respected journalist Whitney Webb.**\n\nHe was never a suspect, I never could find where they even took his DNA.\n\nWatching this documentary just leaves me with more questions and I haven't even watched most of it yet. There was $300 left out in the open in her house, why wouldn't  the Hollywood ripper have taken it?\n\nAlso they said she took her father to the airport and came back and had a ceiling fan fixed but not by the killer because she talked to Kutcher AFTER this took place\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exG4ALz2VOg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exG4ALz2VOg)\n\n**She had 'consensual sex' with another man just hours before she was murdered, says Hollywood Ripper's defense, as it's claimed undercover cops were planted in accused killer's jail cell for 48 hours to 'get him to confess'**\n\nSo she takes her father to the airport and gets back at 5, then she has a ceiling fan fixed, then she has consensual sex with another man, then she's murdered, then Kutcher happens to be late and ends up leaving?\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/hQbKiAz.png](https://i.imgur.com/hQbKiAz.png)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe was shook up that he had to testify as a witness when he was never a suspect. That's just odd to me.\n\nSo, wow getting contradictory information big time. This documentary with the detective of the case talking he says Kutcher was supposed to pick her up at 10 pm, but he didn't show up until 10:45 and that the murder happened at 8:30 and that he had an aliby (but the reason was not given in the documentary)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exG4ALz2VOg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exG4ALz2VOg[/youtube])\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut from his own testimony at the trial of the Hollywood ripper, Kutcher said\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**‚ÄúWe had sort of set up a plan to meet at 8 to have dinner or drinks,‚Äù he testified. When Kutcher realized he was going to be late, he called Ellerin at 8:24 p.m. After informing her that he was running behind, she said she would blow dry her hair. It was the last time he would ever speak to her. Prosecutors believe she was killed shortly after her call with the star.**\n\n**Kutcher testified that on the night Ellerin was killed, he arrived at her home between 10:30 and 10:45 p.m. He knocked on the door, and no one answered. There were lights on, so he tried the door. It was locked.**\n\n**‚ÄúI assumed she had left for the night and I was late and she was upset,‚Äù he testified. ‚ÄúI just assumed she had gone out with her friend and bailed.‚Äù**\n\nSo Hollywood ripper guy she didn't know made a copy of her key, went in killed her left $300 laying around and diamond necklaces/jewelry and locked the door back when he left?\n\n[https://people.com/crime/ashton-kutcher-testimony-hollywood-ripper-trial-5-takeaways/](https://people.com/crime/ashton-kutcher-testimony-hollywood-ripper-trial-5-takeaways/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't find any where that they tried to get Kutcher's DNA, which I would have definitely done and not just taken his word for everything and automatically ruled him out. That's bad detective work at best, or a cover up at worse.\n\nPlus they said the house was like a prison and no one broke in, and that she always locked her doors so someone either had a key or she let them in. Yet they never established that she knew the Hollywood ripper. So I'm supposed to believe a guy she didn't know made a copy of her house key?\n\n**When Kutcher heard about the crime on the following day, he reached out to police. He said he was worried because he‚Äôd put his hands on her doorknob while trying to open the front door.**\n\n**‚ÄúMy fingerprints are on this door and I was freaking out,‚Äù he testified. ‚ÄúI told \\[an officer\\], ‚ÄòLet me tell you what happened.'‚Äù**\n\n**Kutcher was never a suspect in the woman‚Äôs death.**\n\nAnd why would he try to open the door if she wasn't answering and he thought the blood was wine and not blood? So he assumed she had bailed on him, his words, but he tried to enter her house?\n\n **The defense attorney said that only four people had keys to the apartment: Ellerin, her room-mate, her former room-mate and Durban. He said the apartment manager was 'going to be an important witness in this case'.**  \n\n\n**Nardoni insisted that there is no physical evidence in the Ellerin murder linking to Gargiulo.**  \n\n\n**'There are no fingerprints identifiable to Mr Gargiulo. From the body of Ashley Ellerin, there is no DNA identifiable to Mr Gargiulo,' he said.**  \n\n\n**He also argued that there is no physical evidence against his client in the murder of Maria Bruno on December 1, 2005 - another woman he is accused of killing.**  \n\n\nDefense lawyers can't just lie for their client. They would KNOW if there was DNA or fingerprints.  \n\n\nSounds like to me Hollywood Ripper is a fairytale made by Hollywood.

Its stated purpose was to determine the effectiveness of weather modification procedures and the extent to which the government should engage in such activities. ***Methods that were envisioned by both American and Soviet scientists‚Äîand openly discussed in the media during the mid-1950s‚Äî included using colored pigments on the polar ice caps to melt them*** and unleash devastating floods,\n\nAnd so we get to the treaty.\n\n[https://2009-2017.state.gov/t/isn/4783.htm](https://2009-2017.state.gov/t/isn/4783.htm)\n\n&gt;In August 1975, the chief representatives of the U.S. and the Soviet delegations to the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament (CCD) tabled, in parallel, identical draft texts of a \"Convention on the Prohibition of Military or any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Article I sets forth the basic commitment: \"Each State Party to this Convention undertakes not to engage in military or any other hostile use of environmental modification techniques having widespread, long-lasting or severe effects as the means of destruction, damage or injury to any other State Party.\" An understanding defines the terms \"widespread, long-lasting or severe.\" \"Widespread\" is defined as \"encompassing an area on the scale of several hundred square kilometers\"; \"long-lasting\" is defined as \"lasting for a period of months, or approximately a season\"; and \"severe\" is defined as \"involving serious or significant disruption or harm to human life, natural and economic resources or other assets.\"\n\nYou'll note that they were very... liberal. With the wording. With the way they chose to define the terms. They left the doors wide open. And this is not something which was left unacknowledged:\n\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1989/10/27/soviets-experiment-with-weather/cd5bb36c-927f-4d4e-8776-64d6b37f209b/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1989/10/27/soviets-experiment-with-weather/cd5bb36c-927f-4d4e-8776-64d6b37f209b/)\n\n&gt;LENINGRAD -- The Soviet Union could launch a \"weather war\" against the United States and, **because of the whimsy of weather patterns, Americans wouldn't even know it.** The notion sounds like fantasy, but scientists say it is true.they quietly signed a treaty with the United States some years ago that banned hostile manipulation of the weather. **The trouble with the treaty is that it is totally unverifiable.**\n\nAnd so we get to the crux of the issue. It would be completely possible for TPTB to fux with the weather. And you wouldn't know it. The only two questions are: can they? and would they?\n\nWell here is my thesis statement: Climate change is real. It's just not what you think it is.\n\nYou see, people always fall into binary forms of thinking. On the one hand, climate change is accepted science. It's real, it will change our planet. It's man made. It's going to doom us all. We need to stop eating beef, driving non-ev vehicles, burning coal, and fracking.\n\nOTOH: Climate change is not real. It's fictional. It's made up to control us, to tax us, to fuck us up economically. It's propaganda and us changing our lifestyles wouldn't fix it.\n\nBut see, what if the real answer lies somewhere in the middle? It is real, it is manmade. That is why climate scientists agree on it. The issue is, it's not caused by what you think it is. It's totally intentional. See, the elites aren't losing sleep over climate change because even though it's real, they know what it actually means. Let me give a perfect example:\n\nI have shared a few links. All the links were either government or mainstream. That way, there can be no controversy on their contents. These are accepted facts. They're just not... acknowledged? by most people. And I don't know why.\n\nThe other thing I purposefully did was share links that are from documents/articles which were written DECADES AGO. This is all shit that has been around. And let me now share that example...\n\n&gt;***Methods that were envisioned by both American and Soviet scientists‚Äîand openly discussed in the media during the mid-1950s‚Äî included using colored pigments on the polar ice caps to melt them***\n\nFunny how everyone is now panicking about the polar ice caps melting; the consequence of our hubris. OR is it totally on purpose and part of a greater conspiracy? From the same article:\n\n&gt;The Soviet belief that bigger is better is reflected in their grandiose weather plans, including **a scheme to melt the Arctic ice and moderate temperatures in the northern Soviet republic**s. One civilian Soviet scientist told the CIA that he knew of as many as 300 secret weather modification experiments done in the Arctic\n\nHurricanes are growing more intense. Heatwaves are growing more intense. Blizzards are growing more intense. Natural causes? Maybe not. A... \"cold\" war if you will. A weather war.\n\nIs it possible that they are using techniques to manipulate the climate? Yes, that is admitted. Y**ou should LISTEN TO THE SCIENTISTS, 96% OF CLIMATE SCIENTISTS** AGREE THE CLIMATE IS CHANGING.\n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/shortcuts/2015/feb/16/can-the-cia-weaponise-the-weather-geoengineering](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/shortcuts/2015/feb/16/can-the-cia-weaponise-the-weather-geoengineering)\n\n&gt;**A leading climate-change scientist has warned that the US secret service‚Äôs interest in geoengineering technology may not be benign.**Geoengineering seeks to combat climate change by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or by increasing the reflectivity of the earth ‚Äì with clouds or even space dust ‚Äì to reduce the sun‚Äôs warmth.It is criticised by [many environmental activists, including Naomi Klein](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/feb/11/is-geoengineering-a-bad-idea-climate-change), for suggesting that a simple techno-fix for global warming is just around the corner but geoengineering may have a more sinister side.Alan Robock, who studied [the potential impact of a nuclear winter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsrEk1oZ-54) in the 1980s, raised alarm over [CIA‚Äôs part-funding of a National Academy of Sciences report](http://nas-sites.org/americasclimatechoices/public-release-event-climate-intervention-reports/) on different approaches to combating climate change, and the fact that the CIA hasn‚Äôt explained its interest in geoengineering.\n\nLet me bring you back, dear [r/conspiracy](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/), to a time when conspiracy theorists knew that political parties are poison. A time of proud non-partisanship. Yes, it's true- conspiracy theorists used to scoff at the idea of political wings. Now y'all a bunch of drooling MAGA QTard republican christians. But before the great r / thedonald migration of 2016, there were as many left leaning conspiracy theorists as right leaning ones. And really, none would care to identify as partisan. But when the right took over, a lot of \"left leaning\" conspiracy theories went away.\n\nHere's one you may remember: chemtrails. Oh they're so fucking dumb, right? They're just \"contrails\" they're just condensation. Except that they're not, they never were. The guardian article I shared is the perfect example of the gaslighting at play- they bring up cloud seeding, which involved pouring toxic chemicals out of the back of airplanes (before they learned they could do it better with missiles) and then mock the notion of chemtrails- a conspiracy theory that held that the government was pouring toxic chemicals out of the back of airplanes.\n\nDo you see how this works?\n\nI'll share in closing, a personal story. I was a child in Alaska. I drove past the HAARP station once. I didn't know what it was. Years later, when I was living in the continental US. I was in high school. I went onto a university for a science demo. They were talking about radiowaves.\n\nThey had a glass chamber filled with water vapor. They pointed a sonar gun at it and showed us how they could move the vapor around using radio waves. I saw that shit with my own eyes. And it makes perfect sense. \"Feel the bass thump.\"\n\nA few years later, Fukushima. Let me share with you an old video from back in the day:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFw79lQrtak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFw79lQrtak)\n\nWould TPTB do something that would give them the powers of Greek Gods and allow them to smite foreign civilizations without anyone even realizing what was going on? If they openly had these abilities last century, how far have we come? How much more precise are they?\n\nWhat do you think?","score":51,"comments":[{"body":"###[Meta] Sticky Comment\n\n[Rule 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/wiki/faq#wiki_2_-_address_the_argument.3B_not_the_user.2C_the_mods.2C_or_the_sub.) ***does not apply*** when replying to this stickied comment.  \n\n[Rule 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/wiki/faq#wiki_2_-_address_the_argument.3B_not_the_user.2C_the_mods.2C_or_the_sub.) ***does apply*** throughout the rest of this thread.\n\n*What this means*: Please keep any \"meta\" discussion directed at specific users, mods, or /r/conspiracy in general in this comment chain ***only.***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

One of them was Maurice Strong. Maurice Strong did a lot of things and was really a mover and shaker. Of course, as a high school drop out with no background, he wasn't able to do these things on his own, he had the support of the Rockefellers which enabled him to get a job at the UN despite having no credentials or education.\n\nTherefore, him being a mover and shaker was always dependent on the Rockefeller support, which enabled him to become president of one of the Rockefeller oil interests by the age of 25. \n\nIn the 70s, when he helped co-found the WEF, they were looking for all kinds of ways to promote what they'd already paid for: a global problem. With Maurice as the head of UNEP, he started promoting the idea of CO2 made climate change. He got money behind it and those who went along found their public value greatly enhanced,, as well as new positions created for them that paid handsomely. \n\nThis lead to the creation of the IPCC, which Maurice wrote the articles of association for and their raison d'etre: to find man's influence on climate.\n\nThis was in 1988, meanwhile, on the other side of the Rockefeller hierarchy, the Bush family, who had been in the Rockefeller fold for nearly 100 years, promoted CO2 caused climate change within US politics getting funding for the IPCC and any scientist who played ball. \n\nThere are many forms of \"chemtrails\" but by far the largest program was one of the most subtle: they altered the formula of jetfuel and slightly changed the course of air traffic. The effect was to make contrails persist and cover human inhabited paths. The reason was because this was seen as a way to raise temperatures over these paths.\n\nSee, climate change is like a lot of other things; they need to enforce its existence. They need to instill its existence. \n\nThe people say: look, chemtrails and the pilots laugh, ha! we aren't spraying anything! But they are. They are spraying the same exhaust as always, but the change in the formula means the exhaust persists and the change in flight plans ensures greater coverage and no one even realized except the people who wanted the change done.\n\nAs for other chemtrails that can be done and do require separate equipment, we have known of those as well, from Vietnam to agricultural spraying to experimental spraying. \n\nBut to bring it back to your idea that all scientists agree, well, they are paid to. If they don't, if the IPCC said: man has no influence, then they'd be killing their own jobs, destroying their own import and their own fields of research. \n\nYou've foisted many topics into this; weapons research, weather modification, etc, and thats how they hid it all by doing it all under the guise of \"chemtrails\" and then labelling all chemtrails a conspiracy.","score":8,"comments":[{"body":"","score":0,"comments":[]}]},{"body":"One of the best posts I‚Äôve seen on this.

No support, no war. \n\nFast forward to the age of reckless money printing with no oversight and a government can fund absolutely anything it wants to, regardless of input or support of the people it supposedly represents. The consequence being the devaluing of the currency, the money you worked hard and made sacrifices to acquire and save loses purchasing power. You did everything by the book, you worked hard, you paid your taxes, you spent your money responsibly, you didn‚Äôt treat yourself to that vacation, you didn‚Äôt buy that new car. Your reward? Nothing, the purchasing power of your savings was stolen away from you without you even realising. \n\nA recent and extreme example but it gets the point across, in Turkey in the last decade if you had spent years saving up enough cash to treat yourself and buy a nice brand new car (55k Lira) over the span of just 7 years  \nthose 55k Lira you saved up lost so much value that you wouldn‚Äôt even be able to afford a new iPhone. \n\nExtreme example but the exact same thing has happened/is happening in the U.S, just over a longer time frame. \n\nWhen I was a kid I remember my parents parroting advice they had received from their parents, that saving up your money and leaving it in the bank to accrue interest was a wise decision. These days that is terrible advice, you‚Äôre literally better off just buying things, obviously ‚Äúthings‚Äù like gold would be a wise decision, but even if you used a shotgun approach you‚Äôd still probably end up better off than if you left the money to rot in a bank account. And random ‚Äúthings‚Äù you spent all your money on have a greater chance of retaining their value or increase in value, compared to the approach of not spending - it‚Äôs sad and it‚Äôs backwards, I think we all understand this inherently on some level, we just ‚Äúknow‚Äù/feel that being responsible and making sacrifices and saving for the future is SUPPOSED to be rewarded, or at the very least we shouldn‚Äôt be punished for it. \n\nMy grandfather bought his house for ¬£7k, if on that day he also put another ¬£7k into a bank account and said ‚Äúthis is for my future grandson, when he turns 25 I‚Äôll give it to him and he will also be able to buy a house! What an amazing gift that will be‚Äù fast forward to present day and that ¬£7k he sacrificed would not even be enough for a deposit on a house, let alone buy a house outright. And why not? He spent several years working to acquire that ¬£7k, those hours and hard work and sacrifices he made were real, only for the money to be devalued to such a large extent that it‚Äôs essentially made all that hard work and all that time and sacrifice he made meaningless.\n\nLiterally YEARS of hard work and sacrifice can be wiped out by governments printing money recklessly. If your currency devalues by 20% then the previous decade you spent working 5 days per week has effectively been retroactively edited, it‚Äôs like being told afterwards that we‚Äôre only going to count 4 of those days, the other day you worked didn‚Äôt count","score":601,"comments":[{"body":"","score":0,"comments":[]}]},{"body":"First public steps toward the NWO while they gaslighted everyone for 40 years that it was a silly conspiration.

The powers that be (who also gave people religion) basically feed off fear and it's also a great way of controlling people. Even the bible repeatedly tells people to fear God, for example  Proverbs 19:23 says:\n\n*The fear of the Lord leads to life, and whoever has it rests satisfied; he will not be visited by harm.*\n\nThis makes no sense at all. How can someone 'rest satisfied' while knowing that some man in the clouds who knows and sees everything is watching and wants them to be afraid?\n\nSo while one part of the bible basically encourages the fear of God, 1 John 4:18 says:\n\n*There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear. For fear has to do with punishment, and whoever fears has not been perfected in love.*\n\nSo how can you love God (whatever God is to you) if you you're also afraid of him? (I say 'him' but obviously God is not a man.). The bible has clearly been tampered with. There's some truth in it (just like there's some truth in other religious scriptures), but it's very hard to find, and in medieval times only the church had access to it. This tells me that they were hiding something from the people, and when they decided to finally let everyone have access to it in the 1500's, they obviously only made a heavily manipulated version available.","score":38,"comments":[{"body":"###[Meta] Sticky Comment\n\n[Rule 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/wiki/faq#wiki_2_-_address_the_argument.3B_not_the_user.2C_the_mods.2C_or_the_sub.) ***does not apply*** when replying to this stickied comment.  \n\n[Rule 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/wiki/faq#wiki_2_-_address_the_argument.3B_not_the_user.2C_the_mods.2C_or_the_sub.) ***does apply*** throughout the rest of this thread.\n\n*What this means*: Please keep any \"meta\" discussion directed at specific users, mods, or /r/conspiracy in general in this comment chain ***only.***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The forfeiture represents the United States‚Äô groundbreaking use of Mexico‚Äôs new statute to divest drug cartel leader Rafael Caro Quintero of ill-gotten gains. Caro Quintero is indicted in the Eastern District of New York for leading a continuing criminal enterprise and related crimes. He is currently in custody in Mexico and extradition proceedings are ongoing.\n\nThe forfeited properties, described in the civil forfeiture order issued by U.S. District Judge Eric N. Vitaliano on April 15, 2021, were purchased by Rafael Caro Quintero with drug proceeds generated by the Caro Quintero drug trafficking organization, an affiliate of the Mexican organized crime syndicate known as the Sinaloa Cartel.\n\nBreon Peace, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, and Anne Milgram, Administrator, United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), announced the seizure and forfeiture order of the Mexican Court.\n\n‚ÄúThis forfeiture sends a powerful message to drug kingpins in Mexico and elsewhere that there are no boundaries to prosecuting bad actors and locating their ill-gotten assets wherever they are in the world,‚Äù stated United States Attorney Peace. ‚ÄúThis Office will continue working with our law enforcement partners to take the economic gain out of crime through all available resources, including asset forfeiture.‚Äù\n\nMr. Peace extended his appreciation to the DEA New York Division Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement Strike Force, as well as the DEA Raleigh Resident Office, the DEA Los Angeles Office and the DEA Mexico City Country Office for their assistance with the case.\n\n‚ÄúFor over thirty years, the men and women of the DEA have worked tirelessly to bring Rafael Caro Quintero to justice for his violent and ruthless acts,‚Äù said Administrator Milgram. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs order‚Äî authorizing the forfeiture of Caro Quintero‚Äôs properties in Mexico‚Äîdemonstrates that DEA agents will follow the evidence wherever it leads to hold drug traffickers fully accountable for their deadly crimes.‚Äù\n\nAccording to the forfeiture complaint, between January 1980 and March 2015, the Caro Quintero drug trafficking organization was involved in the transportation of multi-ton quantities of marijuana, multi-kilogram quantities of methamphetamine and multi-kilogram quantities of cocaine from Mexico to the United States. As part of its investigation, law enforcement learned that Caro Quintero used proceeds from the sale of illegal narcotics to purchase real estate in and around his home area of Guadalajara. Caro Quintero allegedly placed the properties in the names of family members to conceal his ownership of the properties and use of illegal proceeds to purchase them, and to prevent Mexican authorities from seizing them.\n\nThe government‚Äôs case is being handled by the Office‚Äôs Asset Recovery Section and International Narcotics and Money Laundering Section. Assistant United States Attorney Brendan G. King is in charge of the forfeiture action.\n\nThe Department of Justice‚Äôs Office of International Affairs provided critical assistance in this case.

During the 1980s he headed the Guadalajara Cartel, which was at the time the world‚Äôs most powerful drug organization.\r  \n\r  \nCaro Quintero was sentenced in 1989 to serve 40 years in a Mexican prison for the murder of Camarena and his Mexican pilot, and for drug trafficking. But after spending 28 years in jail, the 61 year-old Caro Quintero was secretly released in the middle of the night on a legal technicality by an obscure court in Guadalajara in August.\r  \n\r  \nCaro Quintero ordered Camarena kidnapped purportedly because he was angry about a 1984 raid on a 540 hectare (1,344 acres) marijuana plantation named ‚ÄúRancho Bufalo‚Äù (Buffalo Ranch) in the northern Mexican state of Chihuahua. The ranch was seized by Mexican soldiers using intelligence provided by Camarena, an undercover DEA agent who had infiltrated the Guadalajara Cartel. The raid netted somewhere between 2,500 and 6,000 tons of marijuana, the largest marijuana seizure in history, and cost Caro Quintero somewhere between $3.2 billion and $8 billion in today's prices, according to The Wall Street Journal.\r  \n\r  \nIn his book, Whiteout\\*\\*\\*:\\*\\*\\* The CIA, Drugs, and the Press (Verso 1989), investigative journalist Alexander Cockburn writes that the U.S. government estimated Caro Quintero's network was pulling in at least $5 billion a year. He was considered so wealthy that the Mexican press widely reported a wild rumor (which is highly unlikely to have been true) that Caro Quintero allegedly offered to pay Mexico‚Äôs foreign debt of $80 billion in return for his freedom.\r  \n\r  \nDuring the 1980s, the Guadalajara Cartel controlled Mexico's marijuana and opium production, but its biggest source of revenue came from selling Colombian cocaine, particularly after U.S. law enforcement successfully shut down the Colombians‚Äô main drug corridor in Florida. Caro Quintero‚Äôs organization did not charge a fee to the Colombians for transporting drugs into the U.S., but retained a portion of the shipments, often up to 50%, that it would then sell.\r  \n\r  \nWhen he was arrested in Costa Rica in 1985, where he had fled after reportedly paying $300,000 in bribes to corrupt Mexican police officials, Caro Quintero was a flamboyant criminal who epitomized the corruption that ran deep inside the Mexican political system. In a 1997 trial of two defendants linked to the Camarena case in California, a witness said that he and several other men once spent four to five weeks counting $400 million in U.S. currency that was said to be the Guadalajara Cartel‚Äôs contribution to the payoff of a high government official.\r  \n\r  \nAfter his arrest, the Mexican government failed to seize his drug assets --36 properties and over 300 businesses in Guadalajara alone -- which ended up in the hands of his former wife and children. Last June the Treasury Department said that from prison Caro Quintero used family members to invest his fortune into ostensibly legitimate companies and real estate projects in Guadalajara.\r  \n\r  \nA second member of the billionaire drug lords generation was Amado Carrillo Fuentes, one of the most powerful kingpins of all times. In 1997 The Washington Post reported that Carrillo Fuentes made an estimated $25 billion by putting top law enforcement officials and politicians on his payroll, enabling him to freely keep running his drug dealing empire. He also doled out millions in protection payments and ordered his enemies killed, factors that kept authorities at a distance. Carrillo died at age 42 in 1997 following high-risk plastic surgery to change his appearance. Asked where the $25 billion figure came from, John Anderson, the former Washington Post correspondent in Mexico who wrote the story, said it was from the DEA.\r  \n\r  \nA third member of the superrich drug lords generation is the world‚Äôs current most powerful drug trafficker, Joaqu√≠n ‚ÄúEl Chapo‚Äù Guzm√°n, who escaped from a high security Mexican prison in 2001. With an estimated net wealth of $1 billion, Guzm√°n was included on Forbes billionaire list for four years. He dropped off the list this year when it was no longer possible to assess his wealth. No one knows where Guzm√°n is, nor how much money he is paying out for protection purposes. The DEA believes Guzm√°n, head of the Sinaloa Cartel, has surpassed the influence and reach of the most powerful leaders of the Colombian cartels and considers him \"the godfather of the drug world.‚Äù\r  \n\r  \nDeeply disappointed with the Mexican government for letting Caro Quintero walk free, the Obama Administration has asked for his re-arrest so he can be extradited to face justice in the U.S. But Mexican Attorney General Jes√∫s Murillo recently said in Washington that he doesn‚Äôt have the slightest idea of his whereabouts.

Why is it? Well I think may have found out, and I also may have realize the true meaning of Life. I know this may came off as a schizo post, but please, if you read you'll see I have a point here.\n\nThe Natural Satellite is what I cell the Space Engine to what make both an artist and the art that lives in all of us. It may also show us the truth about reality and fiction, and about the  ture nature of both God and Creation. Don't ask me how exactly I came to this revelation, but here are The Five Mein Component for the Engine of life.\n\n# The Satellite (Creator/The God/The Artist/Main Component)\n\nAgain, The Satellite itself, the ture main component, you. \n\nYou are the god of your own world you made. What else is there to say?\n\n# The Radar (Creation/The Jesus/The Art/Satisfied)\n\nYou broadcast your creation on earth through The Radar. \n\nThe main characters. Are seen as the Main Characters and Jesus because they known to be you're main and best Creations you have ever done; work that everybody knows you for the best. Jesus was believed to be the main protagonist of Humanity and The Bible while everybody else were just the side characters after all, right? The true art you love to make will give you the true satisfied for your hard work and accomplices.\n\n# The Astronauts (Humanity/Your Audience/Your Fortune)\n\nThe Astronauts who watch, love, and worship very The Satellite that also made them. \n\nUs, humans, us the lesser known creation that God also made as his own Audience. You make your own audience so we watch, play, listen and read about and love it.\n\n# The Signal (The Holy Spirit/Your Inspiration/Desire)\n\nThe Holy Signal from deep space that keeps The Satellite alive and gives it power. \n\nUnknown how or why The Signal works with each and every person/God, but it with tell you and lead you to what you should make and makes you happy. Listen to your spirit.\n\n# The Extraterrestrials (Higher/Other Gods/Artists/What expires you)\n\nOther Natural Satellites out there in the deep Space in other worlds with own Radars, Signals, Astronauts, and Extraterrestrials, who help keep each other alive and well through the radio.\n\nOther God in there own self-made personalized World(s). Every other artists who you know/know of, friends or acquaintances, or very idols who made you who you are and what love and are interested in. Something that would be completely alien to the characters/creations in your world.\n\n# The Conclusion\n\nIt's a god damn film! We, humanity may actual be a piece of fiction made by somebody else. Every other piece fiction we and You have made and know of may actual be REAL in other dimensions, even if we can never enter in to those worlds and will still be considered as fiction to us in this world. \n\nNOW YES! I know this all sounds absolutely batshit-insane and sounds like some Chris-Chan shit, but really, as someone who has always been interested in stuff like Parallel Universes, Quantum Immortality, Big Bang Cycle Theory and the fact that this all may also implies that Christianity may also not only be true too but that Jesus really was God's self-insert protagonist of himself. To me, it's also so reminds me to is this one quote from an old Creepypasta called \"The Life In The Machine\"  a story about a man becoming a god by making sentient AI life: \n\n^(\"I realized something. They were not communicating towards each other. They were trying to communicate to something \"out there\". My meddling in their landscape had somehow made them realize that something powerful was out there, capable of changing their world.)\n\n^(I wondered, whether symbols like Stonehenge and the Pyramids in my own world, could be signs of primitive people trying to do the same thing. Begging their creator or overseer to initiate contact with them. However, one thing was undeniable by now. These creatures realized there is something out there.)\n\n^(I wondered long. Did I have a responsibility to initiate contact with something that isn't real? Or are these creatures real in a different way? Can something be real, merely by being capable of having a concept of itself? And even if they are real, does that mean they will be better off with me initiating contact with them? Should I change my simulation, to ensure them permanent happiness? And is it even possible for me to do such a thing?\")\n\nThere's only one last thing, who is \"Nil\"? Is Nil really God/Jesus or somebody else? \n\nIs Nil a dude or a chick? Are they even a human? If they are a human are even they a human that is anything like us. Or could they be something greater? \n\nAgain, I know this sounds like cazry shit, say whatever you want, I really just wanted to let this all out. No, I'm not trying to make a cult, is just a conspiracy of mine and a new way of thinking about being an artist I have found.\n\nThese are just the thoughts and ideas I have had for years now finally making sense.\n\nI finally understand The Satellite.

Even conspiracies that call out official narratives inside of history books, to philosophical ones that can incite panic attacks. I‚Äôve read and questioned it all. I‚Äôve even questioned my own sanity multiple times throughout the process. \n\nThere is a certain point in the journey where these theories become nothing more than entertainment. Sure, some of them have a lot of evidence behind them, but they all seem to suffer from the same problem. \n\nThe problem is that nobody is ever going to do shit about it. Myself included. \n\nSee, I realized that I value comfort and convenience over almost everything else in life. In order to sacrifice this, there must be a purpose or motivator greater than those two things. I think the same is true for almost everyone here. Some people find fear uncomfortable, while others seek to avoid breaking the law. \n\nOne thing is certain though; nobody is going to do anything about anything until there is a major shift in quality of life, and I believe the powers that be are intelligent enough to know this. They will just continue walking on the fine line between societal conformity and full  blown chaos. They‚Äôve perfected this strategy. It‚Äôs actually quite remarkable and even a little bit respectable. To get billions of people to stay in line is no small task. \n\nSo sure, it might be interesting to read about how the vaccines never did anything, or how trump was continuously sabotaged. The truth is that nobody is going to do anything about it so it‚Äôs essentially pointless to look at any theory outside of the scope of lols.
