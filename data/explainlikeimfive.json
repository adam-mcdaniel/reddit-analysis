We‚Äôve known this, for particles, since Einstein &amp; Rosen wrote it in their 1935 *EPR* paper, but it was only a thought experiment back then.  This is known as **realism** and means that one can‚Äôt know certain things until you settle the system down into a static state, that is, the state *does not exist* while the dice are rolling, and there is no reliable way to predict on what side the die will land.  Only probabilities exist, not states.\n\nWhen dice are glued together (entangled), you can know what‚Äôs going to happen on one die once you‚Äôre read the other die.  They ran experiments to show this effect.  The strange thing is that the dice are not physically connected, like by glue, but generated at the same time by the same reaction, and can travel quite a distance before being ‚Äúread‚Äù.  This is what Einstein termed *spooky action at a distance* and said could not happen because *God does not play dice with the universe*.  We now think he was wrong.  This is known as **locality** and means that nothing can affect anything else at faster than the speed of light.\n\nFor example, if you smash particles together, you can create an electron (negative charge) and a positron (positively charged).  These fly away from each other fast.  If you interact with either particle (settle the state) and find it‚Äôs spin (up or down), the other particle will always have the opposite spin, but there is no way for the particles to send the info of their spin to each other.

I'm going to try to ELI5 but with a little more depth:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR\n\n* Steel can be hardened or softened\n* ‚ÄúHardening‚Äù involves heating, followed by rapid cooling.\n* ‚ÄúAnnealing‚Äù and ‚Äútempering‚Äù are ways of softening steel\n* Soft (annealed) steel deforms easily without cracking (like Play-Doh)\n* Hardened steel tends to crack when deformed (like glass)\n* You can hit Play-Doh with a chunk of glass.  You could hit a chunk of glass with Play-Doh.  But if you hit a chunk of glass with another chunk of glass, things are going to start cracking\n* If you hit a piece of hardened steel with another piece of hardened steel, you'll tend to crack one of them\n\nLong version\n\nSteel is an amazing material. Its strength and hardness can vary tremendously depending on what other materials are mixed into it (alloyed with it) and how it has been processed.  Many types of steel can have their strength and hardness adjusted simply by heating and cooling them in the right order and at the right speed. This is great because you can make the steel soft, which makes it easier to cut it, file it, grind it, etc.  When you're done working with it, you can give it a heat treatment that makes it as hard as it needs to be for the finished product.\n\nAt this point you might be wondering - how exactly do we define hardness, and why does it matter? Hardness is literally how difficult it is to put a scratch or a notch into the steel. Think of wood -- easy to dent, therefore it's not very hard.  Aluminum (like the lid of a Macbook) is also rather soft, and therefore easy to scratch or dent. Steel is rather hard, and some steels can be VERY hard.\n\nBut hardness isn't the only trait we care about with materials. Otherwise we'd just make all the steel as hard as possible, all the time.   Another important strength is toughness.  You can think of toughness sort of like opposite of brittleness. A material that's very tough can take abuse without cracking or shattering.  A very tough material can absorbe a lot of energy, say from an impact. It might bend, dent, or deform in some way, but still not crack.\n\nGenerally, with steel, toughness and hardness work against each other.  If you harden a piece of steel, it's toughness drops.  That means it's really hard to dent it or scratch a piece of hardened steel, but if you push it past the limits of its strength, it is MUCH more likely to crack. Very hard steels (like the kinds used for cutting other steels) can be so brittle that they will shatter or at least crack if you drop them on the wrong surface.  On the other hand, if you anneal the steel (soften it), it becomes much tougher, and will tend not to crack even when highly deformed.  Imagine bending up a wire coat hanger.  It's not going to crack.\n\nHammers have to be rather hard; otherwise the hammer's head would eventually mushroom out and become useless.  They also need to be rather tough, to avoid shattering.  So, there's a bit of a compromise.  They try to make the hammer hard enough that it's going to be harder than whatever you're likely to hit with it, but not too far beyond that.  That way, when the hammer hits a nail, the nail is more likely to deform and the hammer is unlikely to be dented, scratched or nicked by the relatively soft steel of the nail.  And hopefully its toughness is high enough that it can still take some abuse without shattering.\n\nWhen you take two hammers and smack them together, you're hitting two pieces of relatively hard, relatively brittle steel against one another.  Inevitably, one of them is slightly harder than the other, so if you hit them hard enough, you're going to start deforming the softer hammer.  But it may not be able to tolerate that deformation without cracking.  If it does crack, the pieces will tend to fly off with lots of energy (both because you hit it so far and strained the metal, like a spring, and also because of any internal stresses that may exist in the metal from the heat treating process).   So there's a decent chance that you're going to send shards of steel flying.\n\nThat's the general reason why hitting hammers with hammers is a bad idea.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:**  Thanks everyone for all the upvotes and the awards!

Demonstrating you are an exceptional member of your species is vital to attracting a mate and reproducing successfully.  Typically, a Male of a species competes with others for the attentions of the choosy female.  To do so they must prove they are stronger, faster, smarter, better fed, and generally more capable of supporting and/or protecting the dependent female than their competitors, or at the very least that his genes are worth the significant female energy investment to bearing offspring.\n\nIn the mammalian world, these competitions are best done in a way that is synergistic with survival demands.  What better way to prove you can survive better than an opponent than to overcome them in some physical contest:  Fight, be bigger, thump louder, etc. often while demonstrating a handicap that accentuates your ability to overcome (think Ginormous antlers that take a lot of food and energy to make and whose weight alone is a hinderance)?  Even if you lose this contest you'll survive, learn from the experience, and the innate toughness it required in the first place makes you better to survive in the wild generally speaking.\n\nBirds cannot tolerate the physical stresses of violent competition because the physics they rely on do not allow their skeletons to support it.  It would be way to easy for hollow bird bones to break turning a fight lethal 90% of the time.  How to compete then?  For them, physical indicators are better:  bright colourful pigmentation is energy intensive to produce.  It will fade if the male is malnourished.  It also reveals the presence of disease or parasites.  The disadvantage of being so visible proves you are cunning as you're still alive despite it. Coupled with other attributes and performances this allows males to compete with Displays instead of fighting, for a much more survivable experience.\n\nThe reasons behind Fish colouration are less clear afaik.

Atomic nuclei are on the order of 1-10 femtometers (1 or 10 \\* 10^-15 meters), while bonds are on the order of 10-100 picometers (10 or 100 \\* 10^-12 meters). So the nuclei are 1,000 to 100,000 times farther away from each other than the protons within each nuclei are from other protons. That means that the protons within each nuclei repel the other protons in the same nucleus much more strongly than they would repel the protons in a bonded nuclei.","score":1,"comments":[{"body":"The really short and simple answer is basically that the Strong Nuclear Force that holds atoms together is stronger than the electromagnetic force that holds molecules together but the SNF has a much shorter range than the EMF so short that it basically has no effect outside of a nucleus.","score":1,"comments":[{"body":"Exactly, and this also explains the OP's comment about large nuclei atoms being unstable.

This gives them tremendous flexibility to bind to eachother in a number if ways.\n\nThe most basic way is to just exchange an electron entirely, leaving one atom negatively charged overall and the other positively charged.  Now they stick together like slightly squishy magnets.\n\nThen you have your more complex covalent bonding - the atoms share electrons in a configuration that‚Äôs lower energy than they‚Äôd be while separate.  Electrons like space, so giving them *two* nuclei to orbit instead of just one can lock two or more atoms together in a chemical bond.  You have to force the electron back to just one to break them apart, which isn‚Äôt free.\n\nThen you have your metallic bonding, where the outermost electrons don‚Äôt just visit one or two nearby atoms, they‚Äôre completely jailbroken and surfing the metallic crystal all willy nilly.  This electron anarchy is what makes most metals such good electrical conductors.\n\nAnd *then* you have ‚Äúdipole‚Äù forces, where electrons just cluster on one end of a molecule, making it slightly negative on one side and positive on the other.

Trying to complete an orbit in 365 days outside the orbit of Earth results in too much speed which pushes the object into a higher(longer) orbit so it takes more than 365 days\n\nOkay, since we've got those two states covered, how do you get an object to orbit closer to the sun in the same time as the Earth?

So The Sun-L1 distance is about 98.666x the L1-Earth distance.  \nGravity is proportional to M/r^2\nSo the Sun's gravity at L1 is about 330000/(98.666)^2 = ~33.9x the force of the Earth-L1 gravity.  \n\nNow lets approach this from a more theoretical point of view:  \nNewton tells us that without any other forces involved that an object will travel in a straight line. Since an object in the L1 point takes a curved path around the sun, there must be some force pushing that object to follow a curve.  \nKepler‚Äôs 3rd Law states that the square of the orbital period  is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the body‚Äôs orbit. So an orbit at that distance would be about 0.985 years. What the L1 point represents is the point where the Earth cancels out just enough of the suns gravity to make that period.  \n  \nNow lets compare these two:  \nKepler's 3rd law also tells us that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the mass of the thing being orbited. 148.1^3 / 149.6^3 = ~0.97, which is about (1 - 1/33.6). So basically by canceling out 1/33.6th (or 1/33.9th) of the suns gravity the Earth slows down the orbit of the thing at the L1 just enough to allow the earth to keep up.  \n  \nI'm assuming that if I was less lazy with rounding/sigfigs that 33.6 and 33.9 would have come out closer to each other.","score":1,"comments":[]}]},{"body":"It's an equilibrium of forces, but there's more than 2.

The harder gravity pulls, the faster the orbit must be, and the closer two objects are to each other, the stronger the pull of gravity.\n\nThe secondary principle of Lagrange points is that the points are \"stationary\" relative to the orbital body (Earth), which means that they have to complete an orbit at the same time as the orbital body does.\n\nSince the circumference of the orbit (and therefore the distance needed to complete an orbit) increases with diameter, that means that objects farther from the Sun than the Earth must move faster, while objects closer to the Sun than Earth must move slower.\n\nIf you put these principles together, you get a paradox; an object farther from the Sun than Earth must move faster than Earth to maintain its \"stationary\" position, but since it's farther from the Sun, it moves more slowly. The reverse is also true; an object close to the Sun most orbit more slowly, but gravity will cause it to orbit faster.\n\nThe Lagrange points arise because both the Sun and Earth exert gravitational pull. These can add and subtract from each other to change the orbital speed, which then changes how it moves relative to the Earth, if it moves at all (and if it doesn't, then it's a Lagrange point).\n\nL1: Between Sun and Earth: The Sun dominates the gravitational pull, but Earth's gravity negates some of the Sun's gravity depending on how close the satellite is to the Sun or the Earth. This causes the orbital speed to decrease. At a specific point, the orbital speed matches what's needed to be stationary relative to Earth: L1.\n\nL2: Beyond Sun and Earth: The Sun and Earth are both pulling the satellite inwards, increasing the gravitational pull. This increases the orbital speed. Since it's closer to Earth, Earth's gravity varies more with distance than the Sun's gravity, so an object that's too far away will feel very little of Earth's gravity but about the same Solar gravity. If you pick the right point, Earth and Solar gravity combine to get the exact orbital speed necessary to get the satellite to be stationary relative to Earth: L2.\n\nL3: Opposite Sun and Earth: At this distance, Earth's pull is not very significant relative to the Sun, so the satellite is acting a lot like Earth. However, Earth is still pulling a bit on it, so the satellite is a bit closer to the Sun than Earth is.\n\nL4/L5: 60 Degrees Ahead of or Behind Earth, on Earth's Orbit: Because the Sun and Earth are pulling in different directions (but also not directly opposite directions like L1), the forces are not as simple to describe. Satellites at both of these points are being pulled slightly inwards by the Earth, as Earth is not directly in front of or behind the satellites. However, the forward/backwards pull of the Earth is counteracted by the slight angle at which the Sun is pulling on the satellites; L4, ahead of Earth, is pulled backwards by the Earth and slightly forwards by the Sun, while L5, behind Earth, is pulled forwards by Earth and slightly backwards by the Sun.","score":1,"comments":[]},{"body":"[Scott Manly video explains.](https://youtu.be/7PHvDj4TDfM)\n\n3:45 to start the explanation\n\n5:30 to see the combination of forces added up to make stable areas.","score":1,"comments":[]},{"body":"Alright. Let me take a shot (and if I'm saying something wrong, somebody correct me). I'm gonna focus on L4 and L5.\n\nYou know how gravity works, right? When you're sitting high up there in space, you've got plenty of gravitational potential energy. But then you start to drift towards a high-mass object, like the Sun. You *start to gain speed* towards that high-mass object.\n\nA Lagrange orbit works 'cause the same thing happens at the L4 and L5 Lagrange points. Specifically, it works because of the way gravity interacts between objects when they're moving.\n\nSo say that there's an object at L4 or L5 of the Sun-Earth orbit. Why isn't it crashing towards the Sun or towards the Earth? Well, it's not crashing towards Earth because like the Earth, it's got some speed to it. It has to have speed in order to be orbiting the Sun at all. Also, at the L4 and L5 point, it's equally far apart from the Sun or the Earth. Point is, all the forces balance out there and it can stay where it is, orbiting the Sun, just, in the same orbit as the Earth. It's like any other orbit in that way.\n\nNow. Why are L4 and L5 *stable?*\n\nOkay, let's say that suddenly, for whatever reason, our object at L4 or L5 starts to drift sunward.\n\nWell, when it drifts sunward, it starts to *gain speed*, right? Because it's getting closer to the sun, and that's how gravity works.\n\nHere's the problem: it already had a lot of speed to start with. When it starts to drift sunward from the L4 or L5 point, it's on the inside of the Earth's orbit. That speed that it just gained, causes it to go *too* fast, deflecting outward, breaking out of the circle of the Earth's orbit for a different reason, but with a similar result, to a gravitational slingshot.\n\nBy ending up on the outside of Earth's orbit, now it's *even farther* from the Sun than it started as... and in order to \"climb\" that gravitational gradient, it had to expend gravitational energy, just like a ball slowing down when it's thrown upwards. So it slows down.\n\nBut the Earth? The *Earth didn't slow down* in *its* orbit. The Earth starts to catch up. And as the Earth catches up, it starts to pull the object back toward itself.\n\nBut here's the key: because of the angles of the circle, the Earth pulls the object *back over the line, to the inside of the circle*. As the Earth catches up, it pulls the object back not just towards the Earth, but *also towards the Sun too*. And as that object starts to go back over the line, it gains gravitational energy again, speeding up again; and the angle that it's speeding up at *causes it to leave the circle again*.\n\nAnd then the cycle repeats. In other words, the object starts orbiting around the Lagrange point.\n\nNow, the whole orbit around the Lagrange point thing has to meet a lot of conditions in order to work. It works *because* the object has enough speed to be orbiting the Sun.

Some children are born in secret and not recorded. Sometimes birth records are falsified. Genealogists ALSO try to figure that stuff out. Sometimes people who find out their parents weren't biological hire detectives to try and put together where they came from.

Nuclear reactors generate electricity by turning water into super hot steam that drives a turbine. The heat comes from the nuclear fuel undergoing nuclear decay. That always happens, all the time. The reactor makes it go faster with a moderator, but without that, the fuel will still heat up. That means the fuel will *always* need to be cooled. \n\nA meltdown is when the fuel heats up, uncontrolled, and literally melts into a pile of superheated goop. The explosion at Chernobyl came from the water pipes meant to cool the fuel. When the water pumps stopped, the water heated up, boiled off, and had nowhere to go until the pressure built up enough to blow up the pipes. \n\nDuring normal operation, the pumps that cool the reactor can be powered *by* the reactor. Easy peasy. But what happens in an emergency when you need to shut the reactor down? The fuel is still super hot from the normal operation, so you need to cool it down and then *keep* it cool, but without power from the reactor. \n\nChernobyl was supposed to be able to use the residual heat and steam to power the pumps until backup diesel generators could come online. All of the things that went wrong there is its own ELI5.\n\nFukushima broke down because the diesel backups to power the water pumps were located next to the reactor, which was below the water line. When the plant flooded, the generators couldn't be turned on. The location of the reactor was a feature, not a bug - designed so that in an emergency they could destroy the wall holding back the ocean and let the ocean cool the fuel. The unprecedented destruction from the earthquake and tsunami overwhelmed the facility's emergency safeguards. \n\nWith every disaster or near disaster (like Three Mile Island) lessons are learned. Modern reactors have procedures to power the cooling pumps as the plant shuts down, procedures to borrow power back from the grid to run the pumps, back up generators, backup batteries, etc. Monitoring systems and computers have gotten better so that even in the absence of human intervention, the plant can safely shut itself down and activate all the backup systems (to a point).

Plus they talk to the coaches and players in the week leading up to the game, so they know those guys.\n\nThey are also usually former players themselves, so they know the rules of the game and how it works.  If a football player makes a huge catch late in the game, even if they can't see the number on his jersey, they aren't going to accidentally call him the backup QB's name.  They know which guys are out there who might be catching the ball.\n\nPlus, coaches will frequently give the announcers a hint if they've got a special trick play in the works.  An announcer who blabs to the other team won't keep his job.  So coaches will tell them things like \"we'd like to run this trick play where we fake it to Richards, but then we throw it to Johnson.  We've been practicing it all week.  Look for it.\"  So then if the announcer sees that trick play developing, he knows it's supposed to go to Johnson.  They told him about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThink of it like this.  A college football team may have 100 players on it.  Two teams, that's 200 kids.  That's a lot.  But half of them are third string backups who are extremely unlikely to get any playing time, and if they do it's because several guys in front of them got hurt.  And the announcer has a list right there with the player numbers on it.  So if he's thinking \"who the hell is #86?\" all he has to do is look at the list.  Then they'll have a little card or something with some info about him.  \"Coming in for the injured Sanchez is... Freshman talent Tyrone McCallister.  You know Dave they're really pumped about this kid.  In spring training he ran the third fastest time on the whole team.\"\n\nBut normally?  They've got 11 starters, plus 3 or 4 others who will probably get a lot of playing time.  And there are some backups who get significant playing time, but most of them aren't making big plays.  So if somebody does make a big play, it's probably one of like 20 people.  So 20 guys on offense, 20 on defense, for each team.  Could you keep the names of 80 guys straight, if you had a list of their names and a week to prepare, and the coach told you ahead of time if he was gonna do something tricky?\n\nAlso remember that the players look different.  Some kids are tall, some are shorter.  A team might have one white wide receiver.  You see a white kid make a catch?  Pretty safe that it's Tanner Mitchell, and not DeMarquius Washington.  And you know how the game is played, so if one team is on offense, throwing the ball, you probably aren't going to need to worry about any of their defensive players out there.\n\nInstead of having to memorize 200 different names, on any given play you're only having to distinguish between like 4 or 5 people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlus it can be a lot easier to follow the game when you are seeing it live, when you can see the whole field, as opposed to on TV where the camera cuts to a bunch of different angles.  On TV you're at the mercy of whether the camera man zoomed in at the right time.  Announcers can see the TV feed and they can see it live.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd then, of course, sometimes announcers get it wrong.

I had only been watching MLS for about two years and I basically know the names and faces and numbers of the starting roster of my team as well as the subs and some of the rotation players. And that's from just watching the games. Commentators are connected to every facet of the game and are literally paid to study and know it, and were usually former players themselves and can offer the quality insight fans crave. No player comes out of nowhere. For soccer, one can be bombarded by news of youth academy rising stars, transfer and injury news, etc. Players are usually a known quantity by the time they step on the field. Here in the states, we have local high school games broadcasts, college, and professional coverage. So again, it's not like these guys come from nowhere. Their careers are followed the entirety of the time, basically. You'll know players names, jersey number, position, and even their faces if you watch them continuously - which is what they do because it's their job.

I couldn't tell you the name of a single NFL lineman, but we all know the names of good quarterbacks, running backs, center backs, wide receivers, half backs, etc. Basketball is a bit easier since there's only 10 people playing at a time.

It can come with social awkwardness or anxiety‚Ä¶but the two are often unrelated.\n\nThat can look like many different things depending on the person; normal sensations can be completely overwhelming or muted, emotions may not process properly, resistance to adapt, extreme penchant for patterns or habits, and a few others. And each of those can range from nonexistent to extreme.\n\nSometimes that leads to general social anxiety simply because an autistic person experiences the world differently, not because autism causes one to be socially awkward. It‚Äôs hard to be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù when normal things are overwhelming. Imagine being ‚Äúnormal‚Äù when music does nothing for you, or the texture of cotton is like ‚Äònails on a chalkboard‚Äô for you, or if every perfume is disgustingly pungent, or a grocery store is so loud that it makes you sick. Growing up with any of those drastically different quirks can lead to you being the weird kid, and therefore socially awkward. But the awkwardness comes from the society not accepting different experiences rather than the autism itself.\n\nIn other cases, autism can affect key social behaviors like communication or emotional processing. In those cases, yeah, autism is the thing causing social awkwardness.\n\nIt annoys me when articles or other media describe/portray autism as social-awkwardness, because that is only a common noticeable result rather than a symptom of the disease itself. Kinda like if someone were to describe diabetics as being fat, even though diabetes can happen to anyone and most obese people don‚Äôt have diabetes. \n\nTake me for example. I‚Äôm sensitive to sounds and some textures. I cannot ignore sounds; I am forced to hear everything. Normally, it‚Äôs no big deal because one dominates, or they‚Äôre all really quiet. I wear earbuds to the grocery store because the cacophony of loud sounds can get overwhelming, twice to the point of me wanting to throw up. And I cannot stand my skin being sticky. If my hands are sticky, I quickly become so flustered that I can‚Äôt concentrate on anything except for feeling my sticky hands. Those aren‚Äôt normal ways of processing those senses. Talking with autistic people, they all have stuff like that, except mine are sitting at like a 0.5 out of 10. \n\nEffectively, that kind of inability to process properly is what autism is.

Autism is neurodivergence - that is, people *think* differently to most others.\n\nMost people's brains are wired to perceive and react to things a certain way. For example, a normal person will walk down the street and focus on where they are going. Someone who is autistic respond different to stimuli such as sight and sound, so they often will become hyper-focused on small details such as a sign, a particular noise, etc. When interacting with people, most people are wired to recognise that looking at each other's faces is normal social communication, but an autistic person may feel more threatened and uncomfortable when looking at another face and will avert their gaze.\n\nA lot of these quirks will manifest as socially awkward, especially when the individual hasn't learned how to navigate through social situations. But autistic individuals are not inherently socially awkward - quite the opposite, many who are high functioning will be very good in social situations when they know what works. What makes it difficult is that they have to know what works, and that doesn't come so easily when you overanalyse everything and social situations don't follow sense and logic.\n\nSomeone who is socially awkward is likewise not necessarily autistic. They may have anxiety issues, come from a different social and cultural background, or have an underlying fear or trauma.

That means you just find all the places where dy/dx is zero, and then in a second step you probe whether it went from positive to negative (maximum) or vice versa (minimum).","score":1,"comments":[{"body":"","score":0,"comments":[]}]},{"body":"It stands for delta of y divided by delta of x (written as) ‚àÜy/‚àÜx Or in other words.

Now I want to drive the wheels *faster* than the engine, that is overdrive.\n\nThe reason we need this scheme is that a car engine only makes torque in a very narrow band of RPMs. So I might need a really high torque at slow speed, like towing something heavy from a dead stop up a hill. In that case, I need the engine to rev up to 4500 RPM but I only want the wheels to turn whatever RPM equals 5-10 mph.

A wheel that is 50 cm will only go 50 cm for one RPM. If those wheels both ran for ten seconds each with the same input RPM, the bigger wheel will be a farther distance away after 10 seconds, therefore it went faster. The input RPM didn't change, the output speed (the distance measured along the circumference) *did change*.\n\nA more technical definition of gear ratios is actually the number of teeth in the gear, more teeth means more diameter which means it is a bigger gear. A smaller number of teeth is a smaller gear. You can look at a Bicycle gearset, those are technically sprockets but it is the same idea. Assume one ring in the front and 9 in the back.

It's very narrow, spanning only from about 380-750 nm. Infrared spans all the way from 700 to 1,000,000 nm (AKA 1 mm).

Even LEDs, which are very efficient (much more than e.g. incandescent light bulbs) still generate more heat than light. So, to generate enough visible light to warm your skin and the underlying tissue, you'd also end up generating an enormous amount of heat, likely (directly or indirectly) in the form of infrared radiation.\n\nConsider for instance that small radiant space heaters can easily have a power output of 2000 W, and they will feel pleasantly warm if you hold your hand next to them, but won't burn you unless you touch them. Now compare that to modern LED light bulbs. A very bright consumer LED bulb, say 2500 lumen, consumes less than 30 W of power. Hold your hand next to that, and you will feel no heat (even though more than half of that 30 W is actually lost ast heat), because there's just so little energy in that light. \n\nTo feel as warm as that 2000-W space heater, you'd need to output at least 2000 W of visible light (assuming perfect absorption), which at LED efficiencies means also generating at least 2000 W of waste heat.

It's a bunch of software for managing applications, but most of what we need to do needs to interact with hardware like storage controllers or graphics cards.\n\nEach piece of hardware like that is like a tiny secondary computer, and it needs to be told what to do using special commands unique to each model. The way most OSes deal with that today is to have \"drivers\" for hardware. A \"driver\" is some code designed to tell the OS what the hardware can do and to have ways for the OS to tell it to do those things. So one \"side\" of the driver is defined by the people who write the OS: \"We will talk to hardware using these function calls.\" The other side of the driver is the people who write it implementing those calls so it behaves the way the OS expects. \n\nThink of it like maybe your OS speaks English, but your hard drive speaks French. The driver is a person who speaks both English and French and can translate between the two. \n\nApple has traditionally only let Mac OS run on their own computers. Because Apple only offers a limited number of models *and* chooses the hardware *and* doesn't really support buying different hardware, they only include a very small number of drivers with Mac OS. If a graphics card isn't being sold in some Apple machine, it's not worth the manufacturer's time to bother writing a Mac OS driver because VERY few people will upgrade to that card on Mac.\n\nFrom the start, Windows has been about widespread compatibility. The IBM Compatible PC world had lots of different vendors, so Microsoft couldn't afford to support just a small number. Part of what sold early versions of Windows was that it offered wider hardware compatibility than what little competition it had.

It works best if you can build them with hardware that uses the same or similar drivers to the computers Apple sells. Since OSX is based on a certain family of Linux computers, some Linux drivers are compatible with OSX.

The referee then indicates at the end of the half how many minutes of extra time will be played based on the stoppages through an assistant who holds up a board with the number of extra minutes.\n\nA football/soccer game will also continue through the end of the current attack when the end of time has been reached, rather than ending at the exact time.

So I'm going to limit my answer very narrowly to the question you asked: how did the contagion \\*spread\\*? I won't talk about how it started or what triggered it.\n\nThe short answer to how it spread, is that several decades ago, loans in general, and mortgages in particular, used to be held by banks. That is, if Wells Fargo lent you $100k to buy your house, they would hold that loan, and your payments would go directly to them to slowly pay it back. This meant that, if Wells Fargo wrote bad mortgages, they might go under, but it wouldn't spread to other banks or other parts of the financial system.\n\nIn the 80s, this started changing, and in the 90s it got supercharged. Instead of holding loans, banks would package up like a thousand loans into a single Mortgage-Backed Security (MBS), slice it into \"tranches\" and sell the tranches to other investors. The idea was that the lower tranches would take the first loss on any foreclosures or other non-payments, in exchange for higher interest rates. So if you bought the highest tranches, in exchange for a lower interest rate, the bonds were safer because the lower tranches would take the first losses. So for example, the MBS might be structured that the first 10% of any loss would be taken by the lowest tranche, then the next 10% by the next tranche, etc. until you get to the highest tranche, where, of the 1000 loans in the MBS, 500 would have to foreclose before the highest tranche would take any loss.\n\nOnce these loans were packaged as MBS and sliced intro tranches, investors from all over the world could buy these securities. You didn't even have to be in the mortgage business; Wells Fargo would continue \"servicing\" the loan (i.e. accepting your mortgage payments, sending you monthly statements, etc.) for a fee, and forward all the payments to the MBS investors. To an investor, they were just like a regular bond.\n\nThat's how investors all over the world, from pension funds in Latvia, to health insurance companies in Estonia, got exposure to America's housing market that they could never get before.\n\nThis all sounds great so far. Why did it all go down? Well, like I said, I won't talk about what \\*started\\* the downfall. But one contributing factor was fraud: banks would stuff these MBS with loans they knew were risky, and ratings agencies like S&amp;P, Moody's, Fitch, etc. would give them the AAA stamp of approval. And then, when the mortgage market in America collapsed, all these so-called AAA bonds which were supposed to be as solid as a Treasury Bond began taking catastrophic losses. And that's when investors all around the world got affected.\n\nIf you haven't seen The Big Short, I highly, highly recommend it.

The LCD is like the film: it blocks and colors the light partially. (LCD TVs are the same, they have a backlight panel behind the LCD, just no \"projecting\" setup)\n\nDLP projectors are a bit more complicated. They usually have a spinning color wheel with RGB colors, and instead of shining through an LCD panel, the light is directed at a surface that has millions of tiny mirrors. These mirrors can move a bit, so they can direct a light either out through the projector lens, or elsewhere, to block light in that part of the image. You get gray by moving the mirror in a cycle: half cycle on, half off gives you gray.\n\nBy cleverly timing the color wheel rotation with the fast moves of the mirrors, you get a full-color image projected on your wall, which is usually brighter than the one shining through a 3-layer (for the 3 base colors) LCD. However, some people can see a kind of \"rainbowing\" effect because the colors don't appear at the same time, rather in series after eachother.\n\nThere are also solutions to split the light and color it before sending it to 3 different LCD or mirror panels, then combining it again. This removes the need for color wheels.\n\nLaser projectors only differ in the light source.\n\nThere are some more interesting technologies in the world of image projection, but these are the basics.","score":1,"comments":[]}]},{"title":"ELI5: Why is an asset considered 'risky' if its payoffs covary with consumption?","not_safe_for_work":false,"locked":false,"body":"The more an asset has payoffs that are positively correlated with future consumption, the more we should be compensated for this risk and so the more its returns should be higher.\n\nMy question precisely is, how would an asset's payoffs NOT vary positively with your consumption?

That's the one that binds nuclear particles (protons and neutrons) together in the nucleus. (The weak force mediates certain types of nuclear decay.) As the name suggests, the strong force is *very* strong at the tiny scale where it does operate (about 10^(-15) meters), in contrast to the electromagnetic force, which is relatively weak. \n\nThe strong force is mediated by massless subatomic particles called gluons, which *mostly* only exist within the nucleus. For ELI5 purposes, you can think of the nucleons being stuck together by these gluons. One of the interesting things about gluons is that, if you begin to pull apart those nucleons, additional gluons will kind of pop into existence and add yet more binding force to that strong force interaction. They form a tiny chain-like structure called a \"flux tube\" which expresses a constant strong force across its entire length.\n\nBut that doesn't quite reach the heart of your question. Why do gluons behave this way when other force-mediation particles do not?  The photon mediates the electromagnetic force, so why is it that when we pull two magnetically attracted things apart, photons don't generate more and more force to keep them together, as gluons do with the strong force?\n\nTo answer that question, we have to dip our toes into Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). In QCD, the particles that interact with the strong force have a \"color\" charge, which can *sort of* be analogized to electromagnetic charge. This color charge can be red, green, blue, antired, antigreen, antiblue, and white/colorless (meaning zero net color charge), and as with electric charge, color charge is preserved across interactions. (Note: these are pretty arbitrary names; these particles aren't actually colored in any sort of literal way.)  This is where this crucial difference between gluons and photons comes into play. Photons mediate the electromagnetic force but they themselves do not have electric charge. Gluons, on the other hand, mediate the strong force *and also* carry color charge, meaning that they themselves get bound up in the same force that they mediate. This results in the phenomenon known as \"color confinement,\" which essentially means that these gluons are more or less spatially confined within the composite particles (hadrons) that they hold together. \n\nSo the gluons and everything else that experiences the strong force (i.e., the hadrons and their constituent quarks) are all confined within this very small range. The most energy-efficient way to do that (as another user pointed out) is to arrange everything in a single, quasi-spherical clump.","score":1,"comments":[]}]},{"title":"Eli5 why we feel sleepy after eating food","not_safe_for_work":false,"locked":false,"body":"","score":17,"comments":[{"body":"Digesting food takes a lot of energy.

It's why are they so small? If anything, you think about the era of dinosaurs, you had mega animals who ate megafauna. Huge massive plants and nutrition there that fueled the growth of mega animals. Even the mammals of that time, and since then until relatively recent history, were massive. Giant rats compared to today. Giant sloths. Whatever we had today, there were giant versions before. \n\nHumans, smaller than anyone else, just used the environment better. We burned it all down and killed the megafauna, and thus starved out the mega animals to become the apex there. So grass became the most common plant around, and those animals that thrived on grass stuck around. Those that didn't, struggled or went extinct. I think it's the book The Sixth Extinction which goes through this history very interestingly. \n\nIn the modern context, your question then comes down to how people massively underestimate veggies now. We've been taught that meat is why human brains evolved, why we grow muscles, and so on. Meat companies literally paid schools to put the food pyramid in with meat and dairy at the top and suggest it was the 'best' food. The top of the pyramid. And that marketing stuck with us and our assumptions about food. \n\nBut you take buffaloes, elephants, gorillas, giraffes, and other large land mammals and you see that the largest and the strongest are herbivores. If you think about what actually fuels a mammal's brain (glucose) then those question marks start to creep in. Protein wasn't the answer. Eating a lot more calories (and the particular nutrition) that fueled and allowed more complex thinking was. \n\nObviously, those animals can process grass. We cannot. We have to farm and grow different plants. But even for humans now, we get 2/3s of our protein on average from vegetables even with such a meat heavy diet today. It's just interesting that by historical standards, today's mammals are actually tiny compared to their predecessors. \n\nWhat we can take from it for the modern world, though, is we shouldn't assume meat is the best nutrition. Your body needs nutrition. It doesn't really matter if it comes from an animal or a plant for that sake. You can be healthy eating meat or healthy eating a plant-based diet if either are well planned (both have respective risks and rewards). The biggest separator now, though, why humans are taller than ever, is more because total calories is up. The basic formula of calories in versus calories out explains most of this. Even for humans, we're taller than past generations because of this. We eat a lot more calories in childhood than we used to, so we grow more. As kids, that means growing taller. As adults, it means growing sideways. \n\nBut yeah, ELI5, is that we underestimate veggies. Even in terms of what you say about working out 5x per week. Meat isn't the crucial factor. Enough nutrients is (esp. in terms of enough nutrients absorbed). Quantity of protein is more important than quality of protein which is more important than timing of protein. You may also be comparing \"normal results\" to 'influencers' who are on steroids. So that's a whole other ball game. Almost all the popular fitness guys are on the juice.

In that case, for an object travelling at a constant speed, the brachistochrone curve is a straight line).\n\nThe main thing to consider is the worst case scenario. The path has a very very slight angle until just before it gets to point B, and then curves sharply downward. The ball or cart or whatever is making the journey will creep along ever so slowly for the vast majority of the journey, and will accelerate rapidly at the end. A straight line path will let the object accelerate uniformly through the entire journey.
