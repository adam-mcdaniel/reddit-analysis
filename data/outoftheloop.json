Additionally, if a race is really close after all the ballots are counted, there's the possibility of a recount, which would add a significant amount of time to the whole process.\n\nThere are also some races (most notably the Georgia Senate race) where certain election results could result in a runoff, meaning that another vote will take place in about a month.\n\nTL:DR: We'll know the winners of some races on November 8, but it will probably take weeks until all the winners have been determined.","score":219,"comments":[{"body":"Check out this [tool from FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/when-election-results-2022/).","score":77,"comments":[{"body":"And this [tool from Fox News.](https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/864/8b5/1b4b4e6477b7caf1e3bf13529d9931d007-tucker-carlson.rsquare.w700.jpg)","score":252,"comments":[{"body":"I was dumbfounded when I saw your username and the link caption, almost like I was in a Twilight Zone episode.

Most prominently, these are Senate seats (where the terms are six years long), House seats (where the terms are two years long), and Governorships (which vary by state, but are usually between four and six years). That means that there needs to be elections every two years, rather than every four.\n\n'Midterm' elections are those that fall halfway through a Presidential term, so the Presidency isn't on the ballot. For example, 2008, 2012, 2016 and 2020 were 'main' elections, but 2010, 2014, 2018 and 2022 are midterms. (Votes for Senate and House seats and Governorships also take place during 'main' elections, but midterms are characterised by the absence of a Presidential election.)\n\nThey're important because the number of Representatives and Senators a party has can have a big impact on their ability to push legislation through, and because Governorships can have a big impact on how an individual state is run, but also because they're often an opportunity to put what are called 'ballot initiatives' to the public vote: basically asking for a referendum on certain topics. You may have heard of ballot initiatives with regards to things like legalisation of marijuana or gay marriage, but recently (after the collapse of *Roe v. Wade*) there have been ballot initiatives about abortion access too.\n\nIn short, midterms are pretty much as important as any election during a Presidential year, but they usually get less attention and lower voter turnouts. (They're also historically categorised as being a sort of referendum on a President's progress so far; it's a political rule-of-thumb that the President's party loses seats during the midterms, which is... not good for the Democrats, if this rule holds.)","score":60,"comments":[]}]},{"body":"Question: For future reference, is there any website that makes it easy to understand who is running in your area and the views that they hold?","score":37,"comments":[{"body":"[Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org) is great.\n\nThey even have a sample ballot page where you can type in your address and they'll show you all of the people and ballot initiatives that you get to vote on.

The only update since that thread is that he's been dropped by Manchester United. Credit to u/bhamv \n\n In 2021, Ronaldo announced his intention to leave Juventus, and thus there was lots of interest in where Ronaldo would end up. Despite being 36 years old already, an age when most players would be retired or winding down their careers, Ronaldo was still apparently capable of playing at a high level, so there were rumors that quite a few clubs were interested in him. One such club was Manchester City, Man Utd's local rivals and one of the richest and strongest teams in England. This caused controversy among Man Utd fans, many of whom were unhappy with the idea of one of their club legends playing for their league and local rival. Thus, Man Utd swooped in with a lucrative offer for Ronaldo, and Ronaldo officially returned to Man Utd in the summer of 2021. \n\nSince his return to Man Utd, however, Ronaldo has not performed at his previously high standards. There's probably a discussion to be had about whether it's due to his own abilities declining, issues with the team's composition or tactics, or how he's being used by Man Utd's managers, but the fact is that both Ronaldo and Man Utd underperformed in the 2021-2022 season, with Man Utd finishing 6th in the league, which meant they failed to qualify for the Champions League (the top 4 teams in the Premier League get to play in the CL). \n\nIn the summer of 2022, Ronaldo made it clear that he wanted to leave Man Utd for a club playing in the Champions League. However, no realistic transfer offers were made, due to a combination of Ronaldo's age, declining performances, and the high wages he would demand. Ronaldo missed Man Utd's entire 2022 pre-season, apparently due to family reasons (his son died soon after being born during this period), but many fans interpreted this as Ronaldo having one foot out the door already. For the new season, Man Utd had hired a new manager, Erik ten Hag, and ten Hag had publicly stated that he wanted to keep Ronaldo and had plans for how he would maximize Ronaldo's effectiveness in the team. So in the end Ronaldo stayed with the team, but his performances this season have been even worse than last season's. He has generally been dropped from the Man Utd starting lineup, and has mostly only featured as a substitute or in Europa League competitions (ie the team's now using him as a backup or rotation player, not as a star forward). This has apparently caused Ronaldo to get frustrated and behave unprofessionally, such as refusing to come on as a substitute in a match against Tottenham and leaving the stadium before the match had even ended. Erik ten Hag responded by dropping Ronaldo from the team for the next match, but he returned to the team afterwards. \n\nThroughout this entire process, Ronaldo still had his defenders, including among the fanbase and former Man Utd players like Roy Keane and Rio Ferdinand. However, he was also receiving increasing amounts of pressure and criticism from fans as well as other former teammates like Wayne Rooney. \n\nRonaldo's frustrations have apparently come to a head, and he accepted an interview from Piers Morgan and the Sun. In case you don't know, Piers Morgan is widely seen as a hack in British journalism (just have a browse of the \"Controversies\" section of his Wikipedia page if you want to see what kind of stuff he gets up to), and the Sun newspaper is widely hated in cities like Manchester and Liverpool for so, so, so many reasons. So accepting an interview from Morgan and the Sun is already a massive faux pas for a Manchester United player. And then in this interview, Ronaldo basically bad-mouthed everyone, from Erik ten Hag to Wayne Rooney to former manager Ralf Ragnick to the entire club of Manchester United itself. He claims that he feels like he's being forced out of the club, despite ten Hag giving him multiple chances to play and prove himself, and that he feels betrayed by his team and teammates. The things he said in the interview were also oddly personal and vicious, such as saying he'd never heard of Rangnick and throwing jibes at Rooney's looks. \n\nThe fallout from this interview is still happening, but as you've seen, one thing that's happened is that a lot of his remaining goodwill from the fans appears to be evaporating. Even if Ronaldo was underperforming, even if Ronaldo wanted to leave Man Utd, at least previously he was still maintaining some basic semblance of professionalism. Even when he made a boo boo by refusing to come on as a substitute, he accepted his punishment and got on with playing afterwards. But now he's accepted an interview from the most hated newspaper in the UK and badmouthed his employer and teammates. Who knows if Ronaldo will ever play for Man Utd again, and if he does, who knows what kind of reception he'll get from the fanbase now. And if he's doing this to angle for a move away from Man Utd, what club would want a player who behaves like an egotistical, unprofessional diva?","score":1228,"comments":[{"body":"There is indeed another thread discussing this, but this answer is the best in my opinion for us to understand what's up with this","score":237,"comments":[{"body":"As both Manchester United and Ronaldo's fan, this summed up perfectly.","score":65,"comments":[{"body":"as a fan of his, how do you feel about it?","score":36,"comments":[{"body":"Pretty sad that it ended this way.

There are a bunch of factors relating to this so ill break down some common stuff about it. From the very beginning of the profession it was nonsense.\n\nThe founder of chiropractic claiming that \" adjusting the spine is the cure for all diseases for the human race\". When he performed the world's first chiropractic adjustment he claimed that he cured a mans deafness.\n\n**If it is Pseudoscience why is it covered / popular in my area?**\n\nDespite this it is commonly used and covered by insurance in the United States, Canada and Australia among other places.  While there are many anecdotal stories of adjustments helping people, the evidence doesn't back that up. There is lukewarm evidence that it can help with lower back pain, with most credible research putting it on par with getting [a massage](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27487116/).\n\nAdjustments can feel good at the time, releasing endorphins and making patients feel better in the moment, they do not actually treat underlying issues because they are not medical doctors. They do not go to medical school and often get their degrees from *questionable universities.* There is an entire Wikipedia page dedicated to criticism of chiropractic [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiropractic_controversy_and_criticism) and a pretty well sourced article [here](https://mylespower.co.uk/2019/08/06/chiropractic-quackery-hiding-in-plain-sight/) for further reading on this aspect of things.\n\nThe real medical professionals who deal with back issues and the like are physiotherapists but they are expensive. Since [Lobbying](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevensalzberg/2019/08/19/545-million-per-year-wasnt-enough-for-chiropractors-now-theyre-lobbying-for-much-more/?sh=416383871f7a) has resulted in insurance and medical coverage for chiropractic (and other pseudoscience) people see it as a cheaper and faster way to get treatment.\n\n**Chiropractors  are not Doctors?**\n\nMost chiropractors have Doctorates but are not Medical Doctors. A good Majority of schools that teach Chiropractic are diploma mills that usually also offer degrees in other various forms of pseudoscience including courses advocating [homeopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeopathy)\n\nThere are two main schools of thought in chiropractic and you can find educations in both fairly easily in the US.\n\nThe first school \"mixers\" : \"are more open to mainstream views and conventional medical techniques, such as exercise, massage, and ice therapy.\"\n\nThe second school \"straights\": \"emphasize vitalism, \"Innate Intelligence\", and consider vertebral subluxations to be the cause of all diseases\"\n\nIn 2008 the majority of chiropractors were identified as \"straights\". While that number has declined in recent years that has declined. In 2019 a study  showed that around 33% of chiropractors websites mentioned vertebral subluxations, with 8% marketing chiropractor adjustments to children [(source)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337234446_The_subluxation_issue_an_analysis_of_chiropractic_clinic_website)\n\nEven if all mixers use strict scientifically backed treatments and confine their work to the lower back, there is no way to know what type of treatment you will receive since there is no way to know the exact beliefs of any given chiropractor.\n\nOne final anti science fact about chiropractors is that in 2016 [Andrew Wakefield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield) (the disgraced former doctor who incorrectly linked vaccines to autism) was the keynote speaker at the \"Annual Conference on Chiropractic and Pediatrics\" in the United states. Internet searches for \"chiropractors\" and \"vaccination\" will show some disappointing information since about 19% of chiropractors ([in 2016](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/02/17/some-chiropractors-turn-their-backs-on-vaccines/23582549/)) were openly anti vaxx.\n\n**The dangers**\n\nThere is also danger in procedures themselves, especially when dealing with the neck. A somewhat common tool is the Y-strap, which is fastened to a patients head and then forcefully tugged to decompress the vertebra. This has been known to cause short term injuries in the muscles and backs of some patients.\n\nJust a few months ago a woman in Georgia was left paralyzed after a neck adjustment at a chiropractor.\n\nDr. Chris Raynor also has several videos that go into the [dangers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyTG0SnUPY8) and [injuries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9o4Nu3XrrY) sustained","score":9479,"comments":[{"body":"I highly recommend the Chiropractic episode of the podcast Behind The Bastards.

People roll their eyes and point at the plane's carbon emissions as an excuse to be dismissive, but if the conference accomplishes meaningful change, the ecological cost of that plane ride will be more than offset by the good the conference accomplishes. \n\nIf you want to be pragmatic, they're spending money to make money. \n\nAnother possibility is that the players' protest was effective at reaching the crowd. It's unclear whether these players will be safe if/when they return home, and some people in the audience, who had no intention on participating in activism, may have felt compelled to show their support as they witnessed the players taking that risk.  \n\nA third possibility is that they are a bunch of hypocrites who want to watch their football more than they care about women's rights, until there's a way to offer performative support. They might suck. But even if that's the case, we shouldn't become so focused on policing other people's moral worth that we lose sight of the cause they're hypocritically supporting. \n\nI'm not saying you're putting forward this view, but very often the subtext of this kind of criticism is \"well, they're being hypocrites, so I don't have to care about any of this.\" By all means, criticise people who are doing harm, but be careful to recognize what it is you're attempting to accomplish with that criticism, and whether the thing you choose to focus on is serving the cause you support.","score":2,"comments":[]}]}]}]}]},{"body":"","score":0,"comments":[]}]},{"title":"What’s up with r/videos?","not_safe_for_work":false,"locked":false,"body":"I remember it was a staple of early reddit.

Note that it doesn't happen to every sub, some niche communities are essentially immortal, and some subs manage by strict moderation which usually curbs growth and prevents the deterioration. But for the actual stages it goes something like this:\n\n1. The sub is founded and gets niche traction, people like it, it's focused, content is clean and fresh.\n\n2. The sub gets popular, if it's generic enough or interesting enough it will attract attention and subscribers, the numbers grow, posts get more frequent, moderation gets harder, the mod team grows, you start seeing 'supermoderators' (the accounts that are mods for many high profile subs) show up on the mod list.\n\n* 2a. Front Page Status; a lot of times this never happens, but the sub may get added as one of the defaults, this won't stop it from reaching later stages but it will effectively ensure that they will, and likely accelerate the the process to a ludicrous degree.\n\n3. Meme Teir. This is what happens when a sub gets too popular. In general it was good because the community was mostly people that put effort into posting, and making content. However that kind of poster is not the average reddit user, the average user just looks at stuff passively and never posts, and then you have karma farmers who want to put the least amount of effort in to get upvotes who feed on these people. It's at this point, when a sub has tons of passive viewers that you start getting low effort posts from karma farmers drowning out the stuff that made the sub popular in the first place, which also serves to drive away the content creators because the community is no longer fun for them.\n\n4. Half-life. This is the final stage, and I name it after the decay of radioactive isotopes as a direct analogy. At this point a sub has lost the members that it was built on, it no longer produces the content that attracted the crowd, but it's still got a huge subscriber count which means anything you put on there will get eyeballs on it. At this point the majority of posts are going to be either low effort karma farming or those who are looking to promote something and need traffic. The mods are probably burnt out, and there's not much left to moderate since the life is gone, all that's left are either idealogues or dogged moderators deleting hatespeech or spam.

When Magic was first released, the company Wizards of the Coast didn't actually think people would care so much that they would be buying tons of packs in hopes of getting rare cards. So the first few sets had some really incredibly powerful cards that dramatically changed the game play and increase your chance of winning, because they believed it would be rare for those to come up, and wouldn't be a big deal overall.\n\nWhen they realized that the game was popular enough that people were willing to spend tons of money on packs with random assortments of cards, in hopes of getting some of the very powerful rare ones, they changed things for later editions to be more fair in gener. The Revised edition no longer had the most powerful cards, the \"Power Nine\" as fans call them, such as the Black lotus, the five Mox cards (Pearl, Sapphire, Emerald, Ruby, Jet) Ancestral Recall, Time Walk and Timetwister. \n\nIf someone wanted one of those cards, they would have to go buy them from someone who had cards from the earliest Alpha or Beta sets. And because those cards were very powerful and could dramatically increase your chance of winning a tournament, they became very valuable and very expensive. \n\nMagic would do new sets with new cards on a regular basis. But they then decided to do a set where they reprinted a bunch of still useful but not as powerful cards from previous sets. This upset a bunch of gaming stores who felt that their ability to make money by selling the rare cards from older sets was being threatened. Wizards of the Coast, the publishers of Magic the Gathering, made an official list of cards that they guaranteed would never be reprinted, as a way of regaining trust with the game stores. That list is called the Reserve List, and includes the Power Nine cards.\n\nMany fans of Magic the Gathering are upset at the reserve list, as they feel Wizards went too far in choosing that many cards would never get reprinted.\n\nNow, for Magic's 30th anniversary, The Wizards of the Coast decided to do a special reprint of the Beta set. It wouldn't be legal to use these reprints in any tournaments, so it doesn't violate the Reserve List. Wizards decided to charge a lot of money for these reprints though, where you would spend $1,000 to get four booster packs of 15 cards each, and each booster pack would only have one rare card. \n\nA lot of fans felt that was ridiculous. The price was way too high for reprints that weren't eligible to be used in competitions. Fans had long since gotten to the practice of printing \"proxies\" copies of cards that they didn't own for the use of casual play with friends. While Wizards of the Coast has obviously frowned on that practice, a lot of fans felt that they would have been willing to pay the standard price for a pack of reprints that weren't eligible for tournament use. But $1,000 for a pack of four was seen as money grabbing and completely ridiculous.\n\nSo a lot of fans are very upset that people who paid for those and were hoping to regain their investment by selling the cards on eBay aren't getting their money back, because they feel that those sorts of people are just encouraging Wizards of the Coast to engage in such ridiculous gouging of prices. They also feel that anyone who spent that much money on non-legal reprints should have realized that they were going to get their money back.","score":188,"comments":[{"body":"Thanks!

The Moxen are on the Reserved List. How ever many copies there were in the early 90's, that's all there ever will be.\n\nThe 30th Anniversary product is a reprint of the earliest cards, but they are not legal Magic cards. You can do whatever you want if you're playing amongst friends, but technically, these cannot be used in a Magic deck. This is their way of selling a \"collector item\" that isn't playable, so it doesn't violate the Reserved List. Also, the way they were sold (4 15-card booster packs for $1000, with no guarantee you'd even get anything good from the boosters) made them unpopular with many people.\n\nThis is kind of Wizard of the Coast and Hasbro making their own NFTs. You don't get a thing that has any actual value, but it looks like the thing, so someone will buy it. And once someone buys it, it then appears to have value, and speculation kicks in.\n\nSo to recap, the Moxen are powerful old magic cards that we're told they can never reprint. People don't hate the Moxen, they hate that WotC reprinted non-usable versions of these highly sought after cards, and then used an arguably greedy sale/distribution method for them. Best case scenario is the 30th Anniversary product flops and WotC learns to never do this again.\n\nIf you want to play with cards which are out of your price range, just proxy them.","score":21,"comments":[]},{"body":"Answer:  The short version is that they're reprints of super powerful old cards, but are not legal for competitive play.

It's also become one of the most profitable video game franchises of all time.\n\nUnfortunately, Game Freak isn't the most technically proficient company, has issues with QA, and knows they can still make billions of dollars shipping unpolished product. There are a lot of glaring issues with the new games that other franchises wouldn't get away with. Imagine if any other AAA game franchise decided to have no voice acting, constant drops in framerate, and dated graphics that aren't even reliable because half the time there's clipping?

So if you can do something today that prevents *all of humanity* from being destroyed 100+ years from now, that's a bigger impact than saving a few thousand lives today.\n\nLongtermism is controversial even within EA. Most EA effort and money are spent on charities that help people *today*, not in the far future. One of the best known examples is [preventing malaria by distributing insecticidal bed nets](https://www.againstmalaria.com/).\n\n----\n\nThe connection to FTX is that SBF and some other people involved there have been supporters of the EA movement, including longtermism.\n\nThere is an idea called \"earning to give\", which says that it is morally good to get a high-paying job and make a lot of money in order to give that money to charity. This idea was not invented by EA. [You can find it, for instance, in the sermons of John Wesley, founder of the Methodist Church, way back in the 1700s.](http://wesley.nnu.edu/john-wesley/the-sermons-of-john-wesley-1872-edition/sermon-50-the-use-of-money/)\n\nSo there's a story going around that says \"SBF did fraud because he thought it would be morally okay so long as he gave a bunch of money to charity.\" This story appears to be just made up and not actually true.

For example, the Iroquois constitution says \n\n&gt;Look and listen for the welfare of the whole people and have always in view not only the present but also the coming generations, even those whose faces are yet beneath the surface of the ground -- the unborn of the future Nation.\n\nBut all too often I think references to Longtermism are used to deflect critique of current actions by instead referencing nebulous future benefits/plans that don't actually have to be articulated because they're so distant.

Also, it turns out that id used a whole bunch of music in the game that they didn't pay Gordon for, in the form of tracks that they'd initially rejected (and thus didn't have to pay for per the contract) as well as demo tracks and mockups that he'd sent them during the creative process.\n\nAfter Stratton posted his [open letter](https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/gdg25y/doom_eternal_ost_open_letter/), Gordon asked him to take it down, lawyers got involved, Gorton was offered six figures to never talk about anything relating to the album, he said yes as long as they took the open letter down, they said no we're not taking it down because that's an admission of wrongdoing, and this whole thing dragged on for two years until he finally posted the whole thing a week ago.\n\nAn important part of this is that Gordon has brought receipts. He's got screenshots of emails, files, and contracts that prove a lot of what he's saying, which Stratton's open letter did not have and which this Twitter post from Bethesda doesn't seem to have either.

They regularly updated their audience on this story for years. It was eventually considered irrelevant by their competing media outlets, but for whatever reason, the Fox News audience never lost interest in this story. \n\nEventually, the investigation into the Benghazi attack exposed that Hilary was using a private server for emails. Senior republican officials like Colin Powell, and later Donald Trump, would also use the same setup of private email servers, but the \"Benghazi\" story morphed nicely into \"Hilary's Emails.\" The facts of the story were pretty basic (she used a private email server, and then deleted its contents when caught) but the implications became something of an obsession to conservative media outlets in the run up to the 2016 election. Viewers were invited to imagine the contents of the emails, that Hilary then escaped justice by deleting. \n\nWhen Donald Trump won, a lot of his success was credited to the \"Hilary's Emails\" story and the \"Benghazi\" story before it. Conservatives were so convinced that Hilary was guilty of covering up crimes in her emails, and so confused that Donald Trump took no action against her after being elected, that they proceeded to develop the Q-Anon \"secret war\" mythos to reconcile the paradox. \n\nAfter all this, Fox News was eager to find a \"Benghazi\" or \"Hilary's Emails\" story appropriate for Joe Biden and the 2020 election. Hunter Biden's son is famously a crack-addict, which Joe Biden has openly expressed his frustration about before the election. Despite being addicted to crack, Hunter Biden has had a somewhat successful business career, most likely leveraging his father's name and connections. So in 2020, Donald Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani announced that he had been given Hunter Biden's laptop, and that it contained proof of corruption.\n\nLike with Hilary's emails, viewers could make up whatever crimes they wanted to be on the laptop, and then get outraged that Joe Biden was getting away with these crimes. \n\nSo Fox News played this story to their 68-year-old-audience every day since 2020. Like with \"Hilary's Emails,\" we're now seeing the fallout of the cognitive dissonance caused by this story. According to the official Fox News narrative of the laptop, it was given to Rudy Giuliani, who can release its contents at any time.

Why can't the shop owner provide any evidence that Hunter Biden was in the store? No security camera, no signature? Why, after finding incriminating evidence on the laptop, did the shop owner contact Rudy Giuliani instead of the police? How could we trust that the laptop's contents were unadulterated when the chain of custody was so poorly handled?\n\nThe near-universal reaction to this story was a confused shrug, but the Q-anon crowd ate it up, so the GOP is milking it for all it's worth to keep their base riled up.","score":20,"comments":[{"body":"Adding on: As part of the further absurdity of this story, some of the incriminating evidence that Guiliani alleges is on the laptop is CSAM.

He likely traded on his reputation as a Biden to get this position. There is no evidence that Joe Biden had anything to to with Hunter's placement on the board, or benefitted from that placement.\n\nDuring trump's administration, trump withheld aid to Ukraine to try to extort a statement from the government of Ukraine that Joe was directly involved in placing Hunter on Burisma's board and personally benefitted.\n\n\"Hunter's laptop\" is a laptop that was dropped off and abandoned by Hunter Biden at Johnny Mac's. A laptop repair shop owned and operated by hardcore trump supporter John Paul Mac Isaac. John Paul Mac Isaac says he can't really say if it was actually Hunter who dropped the Laptop off. Just *somebody* dropped it off and when they never came back he decided to go snooping in the laptop and claims he found bad stuff in there.\n\nJohn Paul Mac Isaac gave the laptop to Rudy Giuliani. Rudy Giuliani then put it in the mail without a tracking # and it disappeared. Now whenever any hacked info comes out on Hunter people say \"Oh it's from the laptop!

Joe Biden was the one who delivered the message to Shokin to shape up or ship out, and Shokin was ultimately fired. At the time, this decision was hailed universally as a success story; Republicans supported it, Europe supported it, everyone was happy. (EDIT: Corrected who delivered the message.)\n* Shokin later responded to his ouster by claiming that he was fired for investigating Burisma and that Joe Biden was protecting his son's corruption from being exposed. Reports from Ukrainian officials as to whether he was investigating Burisma are inconclusive, but there is no evidence supporting his claim that this is _why_ he was fired from his job as attorney general.\n* Rudy Giuliani would ultimately seize upon Shokin's claims as \"evidence\" to start muckraking in Ukraine, which ultimately resulted in Trump's attempted _quid pro quo_ with Zelenskyy: give us evidence of Hunter Biden's corruption or we cut off your military aid.\n\nTo be clear at this point; Hunter Biden's work at Burisma was absolutely a conflict of interest for Joe Biden, but there is zero evidence to suggest that Hunter Biden did anything illegal while he was in that role. However, because Hunter Biden clearly got this job through nepotism, the Republican party has been making as much hay of it as they can, deflecting any and all complaints about Trump's blatantly illegal acts by pointing at Hunter Biden and saying \"everybody does it.\" And they hope that by prosecuting Hunter Biden, they can find or manufacture weapons with which to attack Joe Biden's presidency and the Democrats in general as corrupt.","score":35,"comments":[{"body":"&gt; Hunter Biden was the one who delivered the message to Shokin to shape up or ship out, and Shokin was ultimately fired.\n\nYou mean Joe Biden here.

It’s worth noting that the position of Health Secretary - which oversees healthcare in the UK - is not a medical position but a political one, and held by a Member of Parliament in the governing political party.\n\nDuring Hancock’s tenure as Health Secretary, under Boris Johnson as Prime Minister, the pandemic struck. The UK government’s response was criticised for a number of reasons, the most prominent being the failure to lockdown quickly enough, the failure to protect those in care homes, and mismanagement of the huge amount of money being spent on the procurement of PPE, much of which went to businesses with little experience in producing PPE (and some of which had connections to Tory MPs). \n\nAs the Health Secretary, Hancock was one of the most prominent faces of the government during the early days of the pandemic, behind only the PM. He was eventually forced to resign after videos were leaked which showed him kissing his aide Gina Coladangelo - evidence not only of an extramarital affair but also of him breaking Covid-19 lockdown rules. Hancock resigned as Health Secretary and went back to being just a regular MP representing his constituency, which is his current role.\n\nI’m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here is a long-running celebrity reality show.

Contestants normally experience a massive boost in their public profile.\n\nMatt Hancock is not only heavily disliked for his mistakes as Health Secretary but is also a serving Member of Parliament who was voted in by residents of West Suffolk to represent them in parliament.

The resulting explosion killed two on a farm in the village.\n\nDirectly after the incident there was a flurry of speculation how this has happened and whoms missile it was. The initial thought was that it was a cruise missile fired by Russia, which overshot the intended target. Also there was the looming question of how NATO would have to respond to what just happened. Ukrainian president Zelensky was quick to hint that NATO should enact Article 5 in response. While Article 5 is vague, it is widely understood to mean a declaration of war from all NATO members. \n\nHalf a day after the incident president Biden said to other leaders from NATO countries, who were attending the G20 summit in Indonesia, that the missile which struck Przewodòw was a S-300 surface to air missile that had been fired by Ukraine. The information in the statement from president Biden was also anonymously confirmed to Reuters by American intelligence officers. NATO chairman Stoltenberg and Polish president Duda also confirmed what president Biden had said earlier, concluding that this has been a tragic accident but not intentional on the part of Ukraine. The Polish president also said that Poland will not be invoking Article 4 or 5 of the NATO charter, ruling out any kind of NATO response. \n\nIn reaction to the US and NATO explanation of the incident Ukrainian officials reacted upset on various social media outlets. Both Zelensky and the Ukrainian MoD stated that the missile was fired by Russia with the intent of striking Poland. Again Zelensky suggested that NATO should respond to an attack by Russia, while providing no further proof for his claims. As the US and other NATO countries stick to their explanation Ukraine has asked to join the investigation run by American and Polish investigators in Przewodòw.

The main reason why I got invested in it is beacuse each character had a name that friends and family in my life had (when the new characters showed up, I saw it as the universe giving me a slap in the face, which is why I kept reading them, to see where they would go. I eventually got invested in the storyline alone).\n\nI guess what people are so attached to in this comic is a romance story about someone who hates everything somehow having emotions towards things for the first time. It may also be a stem of new characters and twists that keep gradually coming that keeps readers on cliff hangers for a day or so until the next one comes, and keeping them invested. Im sure there's more, but its escaping my mind right now.\n\nAs for the deleted comments, the first rule of the subreddit is \"no complaining,\" which people asking why people like a comic so much falls under.\n\nIn my personal opinion on the comic: I like the new story, I like the original idea of the comic, and the artstyle is neat.

Tickets went on presale in the US earlier today in the morning through Ticketmaster. As one might expect, there was an extremely high demand for tickets, especially when her last tour was in 2018 (a planned tour in 2020 was cancelled due to the pandemic).\n\nMany people logged in at the announced time and there were many, many errors. Some logged in and were instantly greeted with a message that there is a queue of 2000+ people ahead of them. And the queue stayed that way for hours. Some people were then dropped from the queue and have to start the process again. Others selected their seats, then when they locked them in, were told those seats were already taken, or that their presale code is invalid.\n\nTicketmaster then moved the presale for the West Coast to the afternoon, which by most accounts was a lot smoother. The presale for Capital One cardholders (which is sponsoring the tour) was also moved to the next day.\n\nIn short, people are angry that Ticketmaster, with the fees they charge and that they should reasonably have anticipated the demand, should have done a lot more to ensure a smoother experience.

These make up a large majority of the workers in Qatar. \n\n* The death rate is better than deaths in India for the same age groups, and some people have noted even better than deaths in that age group in the UK. \n\n* Not all the workers were working on construction, and not all the deaths are suspicious, this counts ALL deaths. \n\n* The 6500 death figure IS suspicious - 70% of deaths have \"natural death/heart attack\" as the cause of death which is not right. These are numbers provided by the Qatari gov - and not disputed by the home countries of these migrant workers (who have rea$$ons to downplay but also advocate against deaths of their own citizens) \n\n----\n\nOutside that article, it is true that Qatar has a lot of human rights abuses, and it's apparently not uncommon for migrant workers to have their passports withheld from them - which is slavery. \n\nIt's also true that Qatar has regressive views towars LGBTQ people, and interesting media tactics. \n\nIt is also true that the most commonly circulated claim is extremely misleading.

For example, Jeff Bezos is not what we would call \"middle class\" though he is absolutely part of the bourgeoisie, while you probably see your doctor as *at least* middle class even though they are fundamentally proletarian.\n\nIn the 19th century, segments of the bourgeoisie (namely the *petite bourgeoisie*, aka the *nouveau riche*) developed the habits of consumerism and conspicuous consumption specifically the distinguish themselves from the proletarians beneath them, and this has continued to be associated with them to this day, which is why the slang term \"bougie\"/\"boujee\" has developed to refer to conspicuous consumption and consumerist ideals.\n\n---\n\n\\* and also partly because in much of the world the aristocracy is either irrelevant or barely relevant as a social class, having been largely supplanted by or subsumed into the bourgeoisie","score":15,"comments":[]},{"body":"Answer: The issue here is that the definition of middle class and wealthy are not set in stone.

You're either part of the proletariat (the workers) or the bourgeoisie (the capital owners).

Indeed, Marx might have called them the ultimate bourgeois, for amassing wealth and power rivaling many kings while still participating in The System.\n\nI'm not sure what Marx would have thought about elected and former elected officials. He's said to have had hope for the US, as a country that had never experienced feudalism (or at least that's how he saw it), but might he have eventually come to see people who were or had once been elected as occupying the same \"ruling class\" place in society as the hereditary nobility had elsewhere?

The bourgeoisie distinguish themselves from the proletariat (the other groups within Marxist theory) through their cultural and financial capital. Essentially meaning they are cultured and own property and have money. Marxism describes the bourgeoisie as a whole as the group who control the means of production and who are mainly occupied with the preservation of capital and the value of property in order to continue their domination of the proletariat.  Still, it is more complex than that.\n\nWithin Marxist theorie the bourgeoisie is split into different subgroups: *petite* (small), *moyenne* (middle), *grande* (large), *haute* (upper) and finally *ancienne* (ancient). Collectively these groups make up the bourgeoisie. To what group someone belongs within the bourgeoisie subgroups depends on a set of criteria such as their wealth, the property they own, but also for how many generations a family has been part of the bourgeoisie. In todays terms, *petite bourgeoisie* would be the current day middle class. In order to become *moyenne bourgeoisie* your family would have to belong to the bourgeoisie for three to four generations and have considerable wealth, but lack prestige that the higher groups have. If your family has belonged to the bourgeoisie for at least five generations, has considerable wealth and prestige but no noble titles you belong to the *grande bourgeoisie*. Being *haute bourgeoisie* has the same conditions as the previous form of bourgeoisie, save for belonging to the bourgeoisie for a far longer amount of time and being even wealthier. Still no noble titles allowed for this group. Finally we arrive at the *ancienne bourgeoisie*, for Marx this was the group that essentially contained anyone that had a noble title or peerage. More classes were added later on by Lenin who also defined the kulak, which was any farmer owning a plot of land larger than 8 acres/3.2 hectares.\n\nYour question mostly stems from how these older Marxist terms relate to modern day terms, so there you have it.","score":2,"comments":[]},{"body":"Answer: Linguist here!\n\nQuestion - Could you give some examples?

Magic the Gathering is celebrating its 30th anniversary next year. In commemoration they are printing a limited edition set reprinting cards from the very first Magic set.

It's perpetually spoiler season with new cards being revealed every week and players are burning out.\n\nThey've done very little to make past cards more available to keep the game accessible. The most controversial of which revolve around some of magics earliest cards, which they promised collector's they would never reprint. (\"Reserved list\") Cards like the famous Black Lotus are on this. People have asked for non-tournament legal copies for casual play for years, but we were told this wasn't possible as it \"violated the spirit of the reserved list\".\n\nFor Magics 30th anniversary they announced this year would be full of events and products to celebrate the occasion. The flagstone of which is a re-release of magics original set including Black Lotus, with different backs, making them illegal for use in tournaments and sanctioned events. (Like we've been asking for) But they cost $999 USD (before taxes) for FOUR randomized 15 card boosters.\n\nA lot of the earliest cards were pretty bad (Think LoB), and there are copies you can buy for less than a dollar from the early reprint sets before they made the reserved list. It's only a handful of cards that hold actual value. So it's likely one would pay $999 and get 4 really junky rares that aren't even playable. There was one product like this with an alternate back that wasn't legal called collector's edition released in 1994.  It was $50 for 1 of each of the 302 cards, now worth around $30k for a full mint set. They apparently used that to set the price of these boosters.\n\nImagine if Konami tried to sell a new LoB reprint booster that wasn't tournament legal based on 1st Edition LoB prices. In addition, stores aren't getting this. Partner locations get 1 box of 4 packs for free, a few select locations will get 4 boxes. These are primarily to be sold direct to consumer, online only. LGS are getting very little support from Wizards lately.\n\nThe second 30th anniversary product was an advent calendar with 30 pre-selected cards (One from each year of magic) through their \"Secret Lair\" online store. Where they sell single cards direct to consumer in a limited drop style format, typically printed to demand within the sale period. These are mostly cards that already exist but have special art. You can usually buy them in foil or non-foil. (because some players hate the modern foiling, they curl like [pringles](https://preview.redd.it/d7i0n2umzgj81.jpg?width=1580&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c916e4067e8fffa8b16cf08b17d8b146cbd95f4)) But for this one they randomized it for the first time, 30% of the cards will be foil. And they had a limited quantity, so they sold out in an hour.\n\nThe reason they gave for the limited run was it wouldn't be possible to deliver them by the holidays if they printed to demand. But many speculate it's to pump the numbers for the final quarter earnings report, otherwise they would spill over into Q1 2023.\n\nThe website also crashed and didn't let people sign in, errors lead to people being charged for multiple orders, it was a massive disaster. Secret lair drops used to be 1 a month originally, now we're getting close to a set per week. There is a deck people ordered a year ago (Heads I Win, Tails You Lose) that still hasn't shipped.\n\nThe main anniversary event was Magic 30 in vegas which was a full on train wreck. This could be a post of it's own but TLDR: Poorly run, overpriced, damaged goods, misleading event info, failure to deliver all tickets on time, messed up the online only ticket portions, poor prize support. They had a space where you could play with your own cards, if you bought the $250 pass. It was a whole hall and after day one it was so empty they opened it up to the public. They \"surprised\" the $700 ticket holders with the $999 packs which lead to a lot of very depressing card opening videos where people got junk. (They also poorly cropped the original art of the cards, and in some cases removed artist signatures...)\n\nSome feel the game is being watered down by excessive crossovers. Through secret lair and now other products, they have been branching out into \"universes beyond\". Which is basically taking non-magic IPs and making magic cards out of them. This started with a Walking Dead crossover. We now have Transformers, Fortnite, My Little Pony, Warhammer, Dungeons and Dragons, Stranger Things, Arcane, and Street Fighter. With Lord of the Rings, Doctor Who, Final Fantasy, and Assassin's Creed on the way. The latest set which was supposed to be about a historic setting in magics past randomly includes transformers.   \n\n\nAfter initial backlash they promised to print in-universe versions of the cards which would be included in a bonus slot in booster packs called \"the list\" which is otherwise comprised of older cards. But they have since scrapped that idea and now crossover cards can be mechanically unique. \n\nAll the while the quality of the product has steadily been declining. With more misprints and damaged cards out of the packs. Even the collector's edition for the warhammer 40k crossover decks ($550+ for 4 decks)  had fairly common errors with missing cards/duplicates. Cards printed with the wrong mana costs/text, the wrong stamp which was supposed to denote which cards from a set were legal for play and which were joke cards. A card printed at multiple rarities based on the type of booster you buy. (The same set could come in Set boosters, Draft boosters, Collector Boosters, or Jumpstart Boosters which are now like Theme Boosters, except when they aren't)  They keep changing what products are by making multiple things under the same name that are different.

It's not unusual for markets to bubble and pop like this; the tech bubble during COVID may have been because businesses were forced to rely on technology more during the pandemic, or it may have just been standard random market fluctuations. In any case, the market is now correcting, which leads to stocks falling and layoffs following.\n\nTwitter is hit the hardest because the platform was never profitable. Elon Musk was forced into buying it and seems unconcerned about tanking it. There's speculation that Elon was only pretending to offer to buy Twitter, to manipulate the stock for his own profit (as he famously did for DOGECOIN.) But because cryptocurrency like dogecoin is less regulated and corporate stocks are more regulated, this led to him being forced to actually buy the company. At first he tried to escape by pointing out how many Twitter users are bots and so the platform is even less financially viable than is publically stated, but this tactic did not work.\n\nSo he immediately pursued layoffs, and may even tank the whole platform. This would be rational if the platform is only ever going to lose him money in the long run.\n\nMeta is being hit the second hardest by the market correction. Mark Zuckerberg bet big on the \"Horizons\" metaverse, which isn't panning out. \"Horizons\" is like Second-Life in VR, which sounds unappealing to most, Zuckerberg was hoping it would catch on eventually. The strategic value of a big VR second-life is that it gives Meta a device category they can lead in. Currently all of Meta's products (Facebook, What'sApp, Instagram) exist entirely on their competitor's products. So if their competitors at Apple, Google, and Microsoft decided tomorrow to ban Meta apps (perhaps due to election manipulation, for example) Meta would be dead the next day. This limits Meta strategically, so they were willing to burn billions and billions of dollars on making \"The Metaverse\" and \"VR goggles\" into the next big thing. But after so many billions of dollars spent, the Metaverse is the opposite of a big thing. The whole \"NFT\" market has completely collapsed, and customers have learned to associate the idea with scams and misery. So Meta is doing mass layoffs in response.\n\nAll the other tech companies (Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Google, etc.) will probably take the opportunity to do layoffs as well, though not for any big dramatic reason other than \"we hired an unnecessary number of people during the 2020 tech bubble.\" Some of the tech companies like Microsoft have already done little layoffs.

Historically Man Utd have been one of the country's more successful clubs, and their most recent period of sustained success came during Ronaldo's last stint at the club (2003-2009).  Ronaldo contributed to Man Utd winning the Premier League 4 times, the FA Cup once, and the Champions League once. Furthermore, Ronaldo has had a stellar individual career, having had something of a rivalry going on with Lionel Messi for the title of best player in the world.  Many fans would put Messi and Ronaldo at one and two on the list of best players ever, and even people who don't consider Ronaldo as one of the top two in history would likely put him in the top five or top ten at worst.  \n\nThus, for many Man Utd supporters, Ronaldo is something of a legendary figure.  \n\nAfter Ronaldo left Man Utd, he played for Real Madrid in Spain and then Juventus in Italy.  In 2021, Ronaldo announced his intention to leave Juventus, and thus there was lots of interest in where Ronaldo would end up.  Despite being 36 years old already, an age when most players would be retired or winding down their careers, Ronaldo was still apparently capable of playing at a high level, so there were rumors that quite a few clubs were interested in him.  One such club was Manchester City, Man Utd's local rivals and one of the richest and strongest teams in England.  This caused controversy among Man Utd fans, many of whom were unhappy with the idea of one of their club legends playing for their league and local rival.  Thus, Man Utd swooped in with a lucrative offer for Ronaldo, and Ronaldo officially returned to Man Utd in the summer of 2021.  \n\nSince his return to Man Utd, however, Ronaldo has not performed at his previously high standards.  There's probably a discussion to be had about whether it's due to his own abilities declining, issues with the team's composition or tactics, or how he's being used by Man Utd's managers, but the fact is that both Ronaldo and Man Utd underperformed in the 2021-2022 season, with Man Utd finishing 6th in the league, which meant they failed to qualify for the Champions League (the top 4 teams in the Premier League get to play in the CL).  \n\nIn the summer of 2022, Ronaldo made it clear that he wanted to leave Man Utd for a club playing in the Champions League.  However, no realistic transfer offers were made, due to a combination of Ronaldo's age, declining performances, and the high wages he would demand.  Ronaldo missed Man Utd's entire 2022 pre-season, apparently due to family reasons (his son died soon after being born during this period), but many fans interpreted this as Ronaldo having one foot out the door already.  For the new season, Man Utd had hired a new manager, Erik ten Hag, and ten Hag had publicly stated that he wanted to keep Ronaldo and had plans for how he would maximize Ronaldo's effectiveness in the team.  So in the end Ronaldo stayed with the team, but his performances this season have been even worse than last season's.  He has generally been dropped from the Man Utd starting lineup, and has mostly only featured as a substitute or in Europa League competitions (ie the team's now using him as a backup or rotation player, not as a star forward).  This has apparently caused Ronaldo to get frustrated and behave unprofessionally, such as refusing to come on as a substitute in a match against Tottenham and leaving the stadium before the match had even ended.  Erik ten Hag responded by dropping Ronaldo from the team for the next match, but he returned to the team afterwards.  \n\nThroughout this entire process, Ronaldo still had his defenders, including among the fanbase and former Man Utd players like Roy Keane and Rio Ferdinand.  However, he was also receiving increasing amounts of pressure and criticism from fans as well as other former teammates like Wayne Rooney.  \n\nRonaldo's frustrations have apparently come to a head, and he accepted an interview from Piers Morgan and the Sun.  In case you don't know, Piers Morgan is widely seen as a hack in British journalism (just have a browse of the [\"Controversies\" section of his Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan#Controversies) if you want to see what kind of stuff he gets up to), and the Sun newspaper is widely hated in cities like Manchester and Liverpool for [so, so, *so* many reasons.](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/7ltwlc/why_do_the_soccer_related_subreddits_hate_the_sun/)  So accepting an interview from Morgan and the Sun is already a massive faux pas for a Manchester United player.  And then in this interview, Ronaldo basically bad-mouthed *everyone*, from Erik ten Hag to Wayne Rooney to former manager Ralf Ragnick to the entire club of Manchester United itself.  He claims that he feels like he's being forced out of the club, despite ten Hag giving him multiple chances to play and prove himself, and that he feels betrayed by his team and teammates.  The things he said in the interview were also oddly personal and vicious, such as saying he'd never heard of Rangnick and throwing jibes at Rooney's looks.  \n\nThe fallout from this interview is still happening, but as you've seen, one thing that's happened is that a lot of his remaining goodwill from the fans appears to be evaporating.  Even if Ronaldo was underperforming, even if Ronaldo wanted to leave Man Utd, at least previously he was still maintaining some basic semblance of professionalism.  Even when he made a boo boo by refusing to come on as a substitute, he accepted his punishment and got on with playing afterwards.  But now he's accepted an interview from the most hated newspaper in the UK and badmouthed his employer and teammates.  Who knows if Ronaldo will ever play for Man Utd again, and if he does, who knows what kind of reception he'll get from the fanbase now.  And if he's doing this to angle for a move away from Man Utd, what club would want a player who behaves like an egotistical, unprofessional diva?","score":1093,"comments":[{"body":"Thanks for a really interesting and well written summary!

The driver with the most points at the end of the season wins the Driver’s Championship, and the team with the most points (both drivers’ points combined) wins the Constructor’s championship. \n\nFor the current season, both championships have already been decided, with Max Verstappen winning the WDC and his team, Red Bull, winning the WCC. However, while the championship may be clinched, the battle for second place is still very close, with Sergio Perez, Max’s teammate at Redbull, and Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc having only a 5 point difference before this weekend’s race. This means that for them, every single point matters in the battle for 2nd place, especially with 2 races remaining. \n\nCut to this weekend’s race in Brazil, with about 10 laps remaining, Leclerc is in 4th position, Perez in 6th, and Verstappen coming fast from behind, eventually overtaking Perez and landing in 6th. The team tells Perez that Verstappen will try and get past Leclerc, taking away from his point total, but if he cannot get it done by the end of the race, they will give his position back, as every little point matters. With 2 laps to go, Verstappen didn’t manage to make it out of 6th place, and is asked to give the position to Perez. This normally shouldn’t be a problem, since Max has nothing to gain from getting 6th instead of 7th, as his championship is already confirmed, but instead refuses. This is what he told the team: \"I told you already last time, you guys don't ask that again to me, okay? Are we clear about that? I gave my reasons and I stand by it.\" \n\nThis essentially caused a massive fallout between the two teammates, with Perez saying that Verstappen is “showing who he is” and that he wouldn’t have 2 championships if it weren’t for him. While that may be a bit exaggerated, Perez really did help Verstappen a lot in winning his first championship last year. \n\nThere is also a lot of speculation regarding Max’s “reasons” as to refusing the team’s request. The leading theory, which has come out from multiple independent sources, is that Perez intentionally crashed during qualifying in Monaco to secure his own position, and inadvertently hurting Max’s chances to a good qualifying and potential win. It’s also important to note that Perez ended up winning in Monaco. While this is a very weird and outlandish accusation, it is weird that it’s come up from different people. It was even the first theory that Martin Brundle, commentator for Sky Sports, brought up seemingly out of nowhere when the incident happened. \n\nOverall, the whole situation is a mess that could potentially cost Perez 2nd place, and that could’ve been easily avoided if Verstapped vas more cooperative.","score":42,"comments":[{"body":"Thank you! This was very thorough and helpful. It's really interesting that this theory was brought up by so many different people","score":10,"comments":[]}]},{"body":"Answer:\n\n**Context:**\n\nMax Verstappen is the 2022 Driver's champion (he's so far ahead he can't be beaten now). Perez, his team mate at Red Bull, is in a battle for second place with Ferrari's Leclerc. They are separated by just a few points.\n\nDuring this weekend's race, the team told Perez to let Verstappen past late in the race because he was faster. Verstappen couldn't overtake the next car though, so on the last lap they asked him to give the position back to Perez. He refused.\n\nThis is odd because it gains him nothing - he's won the championship already - and the points are very important to Perez. He alienated his team mate, gained nothing, and the radio messages around the refusal show there's bad blood; also odd given Perez has done nothing but help Verstappen win the last two years.\n\n**Monaco:**\n\nAt the time of the broadcast, the main english channel presenter wondered aloud if this had something to do with Monaco. This is even more odd - it came out of the blue because nothing really happened there, and nothing's been said to date.\n\nThen post-race rumours from a multitude of sources started bringing up Perez's Qualifying crash in Monaco, and then a more specific accusation from a Verstappen-aligned journalist came out that the Monaco \"incident\" was Perez intentionally crashing during qualification while he was ahead of Verstappen, causing the session to be stopped and ultimately ended. Monaco is notoriously hard to overtake at, so this is a big advantage. The odd thing here is Perez was only 3rd (Verstappen 4th). It's a big advantage for the race, but not really from a macro scale.\n\nCrashing intentionally, however, is a *big* deal. If you are found guilty we're talking disqualification, bans and big fines. It's not taken lightly. It's a lot to risk for a single position. All quite odd.\n\n**Details:**\n\nThe only true \"proof\" of whether he crashed intentionally or not is an admission of guilt. There are rumours he admitted this internally to the team bosses which is how Verstappen found out, but these aren't proven at all and the team is far too good at PR to ever speak on it.\n\nThat being said, we have throttle traces of the incident and onboard replays. They're damning. Every lap previously he's on the throttle at this corner at the same time with the same pressure. Then the lap he crashes he's on the throttle very early, and instead of gradually adding power he stomps on the pedal. The onboard replay shows this happens before he's even half way around the corner. It's not a slam dunk, but it's very, very damning, it's a series of multiple mistakes made simultaneously. One is poor performance, two is odd, three is, well I'm not going to make accusations, but three is a lot from one of the best drivers on the planet to happen all at the same corner.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nIt's all very odd and nothing adds up. There are weird bits of seemingly certain evidence here and there, but when you take these puzzle pieces to assemble the picture, none of them fit quite right. No one knows for sure what's going on, and we may never, but the F1 world will be talking about this all winter long.\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nVerstappen after being helped all season by his team mate Perez, decided to intentionally screw him over when it competitively gained Verstappen nothing and hurt Perez not insignificantly.\n\nRumours come out of the blue that Perez intentionally crashed earlier in the season to gain an advantage over Verstappen, and that Verstappen is still angry about it. The evidence of an intentional crash looks solid, but it was to gain a very small advantage at extreme risk.\n\nNothing quite adds up about all this and frankly we're unlikely to ever know the details unless someone talks or makes a litigable accusation.","score":13,"comments":[{"body":"Was the perez crash suspicious when it first happened?

In almost every state save for New York and Florida, republicans did very poorly compared to expectations. This is especially true of trump endorsed candidates. *Most* All of Trumps senate candidates save for JD Vance and maybe Walker have lost, ensuring the dems keep the senate another 2 years. All election denying republican candidates for secretaries of state and governors (save for Kari Lake of AZ, whose race is still a tossup) have also lost.\n\nBasically, many republicans are starting to see trump as a massive political liability (because recently, it’s pretty indisputable that he is). He divides the gop base, endorses extremist candidates, picks fights with some of the few popular figures in party leadership, and most importantly: is losing the party seats at what should’ve been an EASY midterm victory. Many of the things that worked to get him elected are now working against him and the gop\n\nLastly, trump has recently come out swinging at DeSantis (who, like I mentioned earlier, is probably the most single handed Republican success story of the last couple years). If the republicans want to have a shot at winning nationally, they need to take notes from desantis, and I think it’s pissing a lot of GOP talking heads off that their golden “leader” is taking petty shots at a popular gop gov.

They're voting.  They're disproportionately democrat.\n\nAnd why are younger people disproportionately democrat?  Because the RNC has, for literally 2 decades now, held incredibly unpopular social and political positions (back when they still had official platforms before the more recent official platform of: \"whatever Trump Wants\" and \"we will do nothing but oppose what democrats want\").  They've kept power because senior citizens vote far more than young people and because of a few key issues like abortions or gun control.  \n\nBut young people care about trans rights, abortion rights, societal equality, fiscal fairness, healthcare, education and climate change... all things republican candidates vehemently oppose.\n\nWhile it's easy to blame Trump for this loss it is just a shifting of blame from a party that is growing increasingly irrelevant.","score":397,"comments":[{"body":"","score":0,"comments":[]}]},{"body":"","score":0,"comments":[]}]},{"body":"","score":0,"comments":[]}]},{"title":"What's the deal with conservatives/conspiracy theorists and the World Economic Forum?","not_safe_for_work":false,"locked":false,"body":"Up until a few weeks ago, I hadn't even heard of this organization.

You can resell it, lend it out, and so on. Part of the result of those rules is that a publisher must sell books to libraries at about the same price as they sell to regular consumers. If they didn't, then the library could just buy them through an intermediary.\n\nWith the transition to ebooks, major publishers have changed the game. No longer are you buying a book that you own, instead you are buying a license to a book. This license is not transferable, it doesn't give you any of the rights that owning a book would. It also allows the publishers to charge different prices for library books as regular books. In general, a library will pay a price that is 5-10 times as high as a consumer, and on top of that the book will automatically expire within 1-2 years, or if gets read more than 24 times.\n\nThe Internet Archive has opted not to buy ebooks, but instead buy physical books, and have them scanned. Then, for each book that they have physically in their inventory, they lend out 1 scanned book online at a time. This practice is called Controlled Digital Lending. The Internet Archive argues that it's fair use, because a library does have the right to transition a book from one form to another for preservation sake (traditionally this was used to save stuff onto microfilm). Publishers argue that it's a violation of intellectual property, that the DRM used in Controlled Digital Lending is trivial to evade, and so on.\n\nOn top of that, there was an additional decision taken by the internet archive during the initial Covid Lockdown, to just lend out all books without limitation. This greatly rankled the big publishers and was the direct cause for the lawsuit, but the lawsuit affects all Controlled Digital Lending, not just the Covid emergy program (which operated for about 3 months).","score":24,"comments":[]},{"body":"Answer: I can at least partially answer.

An EO is issued by the President and regulates the operation of the Federal government.

Most of the time, any rules having to do with budgeting have to go through Congress, and the judge who overruled the EO says this restriction applies in this case.   \n\n\nbetween the weak legal reasoning and the fact the judge was appointed by Trump , some people have speculated that this appears to be a politically motivated ruling (to prevent Biden from having any accomplishments to brag about) rather than a legitimate legal ruling.  \n\n\nIf I recall correctly, Congress didn't take up loan debt forgiveness on their own because of a ruling from the Senate Parliamentarian saying they needed 60 votes (to overcome a filibuster) to do it rather than 51 (no filibuster because it's using a method known as \"Reconciliation\") .

The President's argument is that his authority comes from the \"HEROES Act\", which was passed after the September 11th attacks and allows the President to waive or modify student loan obligations for individuals affected by \"a war or other military operation or national emergency\".  See: https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/leg/foia/secretarys-legal-authority-for-debt-cancellation.pdf\n\nIt's clear to everybody that the HEROES Act wasn't *intended* to cancel student loans for all low income Americans, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's not allowed.  Personally, I think it's a pretty weak argument, especially since he didn't actually cancel the loans until the worst of the COVID pandemic was over.  (He did use the same authority to temporarily suspend loan payments during the pandemic, which is much more reasonable.)  Congress is almost completely broken, and it will only get worse for the foreseeable future, but giving the President the power to ignore Congress and do whatever he wants is not a good solution.","score":59,"comments":[{"body":"Just because the impacts of an emergency take a little while to be better understood, that does not invalidate them.

Danno's bosses were told to return him to his old job.\n\n&gt; But Danno wasn't returned to his post, and was instead re-assigned to a job processing parking permits two hours away from his house. So Danno filed an official whistleblower complaint with the Office of the Inspector General, which condemned the NPS' decision to allow the tree-cutting after reviewing Danno's allegations. Danno paid for that, too:\n\n&gt; In August of 2007, while Danno was in Colorado Springs for his son's first day at the Air Force Academy, his West Virginia farm was raided by U.S. Marshals. He flew home, only to find out that the feds had issued a warrant for his arrest and had classified him as a threat to the public, and perhaps himself. Danno spent a night drinking alone on his boat in the Potomac, and in the morning sped upstream to the C&amp;O Canal boat launch, where he was arrested by an NPS SWAT team and charged with theft of federal property.\n\n&gt; The tab: $5,408.76 in collectible badges, emergency medical kits, a drill, and various other tools. According to the NPS, Danno had sweet-talked a desk employee at the park's regional headquarters into offering him access to the room where she stored a collection of historic badges from various national park sites and missions—and then made off with them. According to Danno—and, more to the point, his extensive paper trail and line of witnesses—those badges had either been earned or gifted. The National Park Service pressed the issue, securing an indictment in May of 2008, and then taking the case to the federal court, where, as Danno was made well aware, the NPS almost never loses. But the evidence was overwhelmingly in Danno's favor; after his supervisor revealed that he had transported Danno's \"stolen\" property to his home in his own car, the jury needed just a few minutes to acquit Danno in February of 2009.\n\nhttps://deadspin.com/dan-snyder-killed-some-trees-and-a-park-ranger-paid-th-1494113337","score":57,"comments":[{"body":"","score":0,"comments":[]}]},{"body":"","score":0,"comments":[]}]},{"body":"","score":0,"comments":[]}]},{"body":"It was seen as doubly terrible because a) the shooting doesn't fall under the DC AG's jurisdiction, and b) two people have already been arrested in connection to the shooting.","score":273,"comments":[{"body":"B) really shows how much attention they paid to the event of Robinson getting shot in the first place....","score":83,"comments":[{"body":"","score":0,"comments":[]}]},{"body":"","score":0,"comments":[]}]},{"body":"Also for anyone curious, Brian Robinson is back playing already.

If you want to make an album that you can put on Spotify or sell in stores or whatever, you have to take that music and make it into actual songs. Which is a process that apparently [ran into some problems](https://medium.com/@mickgordon/my-full-statement-regarding-doom-eternal-5f98266b27ce).\n\nImportant to note is that the Doom 2016 OST wasn't put together like this--it was actually made entirely by Mick Gordon, and is widely regarded as being extremely dope.\n\nEdited to add clarification that we're talking about the Doom Eternal OST, not the Doom 2016 one.","score":185,"comments":[{"body":"The OST might have been the major issue, but that's only the tip of the iceberg. To add to that - you've completely left out the parts where they:\n\n* Didn't pay him for 11 months - this was his only source of income and he has a family to feed.\n* Insisted on him delivering fully finalised songs that matched gameplay and levels, before the levels had been created.\n* Announced the OST with his name on the cover before they even told him it was going to be created. (Imagine a music label announcing new album without consulting the band).\n* Gave him less than a month to put together an entire album.\n* Had in-house staff come up with an incredibly poor quality, hacked together alternative as a plan B, without telling him.\n* Blamed the poor quality on Mick in an open letter on /r/doom\n* This caused Mick to get blackballed by other developers, his reputation was ruined.\n* Angry fans sent him death threats and harassed his other clients to the point where they dropped him.\n* Tried to offer him a six figure gagging order to publicly take the blame and never tell the truth - just so that the director could \"save face\" and not admit his fuckup.\n* They also used more than twice the amount of music he was paid for, including recordings he had sent them and id software rejected as not good enough. They never paid him for all this extra work.\n* As an extra fuck you - both soundtracks won a bunch of awards for \"best soundtrack of the year\" etc. Marty invited HIMSELF to these events and accepted the awards on id's/Mick's behalf. Mick, the actual artist who wrote and recorded all the music, has never even been allowed to hold them.\n\nSo yeah, id software and Marty stratton in particular are horrible.","score":75,"comments":[{"body":"You're quite right, but when I posted my answer /u/pfm1995 had already posted some of that and someone had posted a link to the Kotaku article with a summary, so I figured I'd just quickly clarify the primary misconception that OP seemed to be working under.

It's... pretty damning stuff - Mick seems to have kept receipts, and his rebuttal has generated a lot of buzz.\n\n**The longer version, for those lacking in some context:**\n\nDOOM (2016) released to critical and commercial success with pretty much everyone from industry critics to fans to independent musicians lavishing particular praise on its soundtrack, composed by Mick Gordon. So, when DOOM: Eternal was announced, everyone rejoiced to hear that Mick was tapped as the composer again. \n\nAnd then the troubles started.\n\nThe exact nature of what happened during development is up for debate; Mick Gordon and Id Software have provided contrasting accounts (linked above). What is certain is that, when the DOOM: Eternal OST was released, it was derided for being extremely poor quality - poor audio compression, artifacts, popping, you name it, it was a problem. Fans complained, and Mick Gordon released a [tweet](https://twitter.com/Mick_Gordon/status/1251828567882600448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1251828567882600448%7Ctwgr%5E0aa20858d4585bff65187e3b8f5a4cf015460e8b%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fembed%2Finset%2Fiframe%3Fid%3Dtwitter-1251828567882600448autosize%3D1) in response saying he hadn't worked on parts of the OST. This, understandably, shocked people - he was the composer, after all, and his name was on the credits.\n\nShortly thereafter, Marty Stratton released his statement above, and two days ago Mick Gordon released his rebuttal. Mick Gordon's rebuttal has been amplified by fans and media outlets, what happens next is anyone's guess.","score":37,"comments":[{"body":"Ohh thanks for clarifying.
