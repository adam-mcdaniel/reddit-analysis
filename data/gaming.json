It screams of \"we have a Nintendo at home\" type of gift. I need kids can be mature and thankful, but kids are dumb too lol, I was. So if I send them an old original ps4, when they wanted a PS5, they might be pretty disappointed at \"out of touch\" adults.

Playing happy games or playing games that have a lot of action that give you a lot of dopamine are sometimes just scary because there's no one to be with you at that moment and some games I can tolerate being alone like The binding of Isaac or hollow Knight but besides those games it is just too hard to play without people. games that are in 2D are easy to deal with loneliness but games that are in 3D there's a vast world that is way bigger and stronger than you.
