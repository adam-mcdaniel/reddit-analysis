Plenty of people also use UPS (not USPS).  I‚Äôd be more concerned about the luggage handlers on your MIL‚Äôs flight than the shipping company you choose. I‚Äôve heard more stories about gear getting trashed by airline companies than Fedex or UPS. \n\nMake sure the boxes aren‚Äôt bigger than they need to be. Everyone uses ‚Äúdimensional weight‚Äù instead of ‚Äúactual weight‚Äù so if your box is 5lbs, but it‚Äôs   29‚Äùx29‚Äùx29‚Äù you‚Äôre gonna get charged a ton for shipping. Your MIL can add insurance based on the value your gear when she ships your packages. Cost will be based on the value you provide. If you don‚Äôt pack your gear properly they may not cover it if something happens. Make sure your boxes are double walled or pretty darn sturdy. Don‚Äôt go cheap. I‚Äôd imagine they‚Äôll re-use the boxes to ship your gear back to you so you need them to be quality. Make sure you pack the box so your packing material will absorb any impacts or pressure from being stacked. I also do the ‚Äúshake test‚Äù when I box stuff. You don‚Äôt want your gear moving around. Sometimes I will roll some cardboard into tubes or cubes to add some reinforcement if I‚Äôm sending something especially fragile. \n\nHope this helps.\n\nEdit: I‚Äôd also take pics of your gear before your MIL flies just in case the airline causes damage.","score":2,"comments":[{"body":"Thanks!

There's no water source there. So it has to be a leak. Or if you run the dryer and it suddenly jumps to 80% humidity, then it isn't venting correctly. Or if something like the humidity in a bathroom after a shower doesn't clear quickly and hangs around for hours. These are all problems that can be discovered by measuring different humidities at the same temperature.\n\nIt's about figuring how your day-to-day activities are affecting the humidity. Then changing the easy ones first and finding then fixing anything that is broken.","score":2,"comments":[]}]}]},{"body":"Part of the problem is that the blinds (or curtains if someone is using them), are blocking off air circulation from the surface of the glass. The lower outside air temp cools the glass, and the blind prohibits air movement across the glass that would warm up the inner surface. If you need a thermal blind, something is wrong or just inadequate with the window itself, or how its installed. Air leaks, even minor ones, getting trapped behind a blind would cool the window and the trapped air pocket quite quickly. \n\nUnfortunately leaving the blinds open during the coldest parts of the day will help with condensation, but defeat the purpose of having blinds in the first place. Humans, pets, plants, showers and sinks, all pump moisture iinto the air.","score":7,"comments":[]},{"body":"Is the condensation inside or outside?","score":3,"comments":[{"body":"","score":0,"comments":[]}]},{"body":"dehumidifier will sort this out, we recently got one and they are great!","score":2,"comments":[]},{"body":"You may buy a transparent foil at the home&amp;garden marked which is attached to the frame and works like a third glass pane. This would resolve the heavy condensation.\nYour real problem however is high air humidity. You will also get mold in the upper room corners. Do ventilate your apartment well three times a day. The condensation on the windows removes humidity from the air -- better use no foil and clean the window when condensed.","score":4,"comments":[{"body":"High humidity isn‚Äôt necessarily the problem here. If OP has any thermal barrier on the *inside* of the window and does at the same time not seal the air from the room from getting to the window then it‚Äôs just physics. Even normal air temp will cause this. This is essentially applying thermal insulation on the inside of the building which is not ideal and has to be accompanied with a foil that doesn‚Äôt ket the insude ait to travel through insulation to the cold part of construction. \n\nIn short - never put any thermal insulative material on the inside without at the same time cutting off passage of inside air through that insulation to the cold spot.","score":3,"comments":[]}]},{"body":"Wipe with a towel every morning to prevent mold.\n\nIf you use a dehumidifier, you may lower the humidity too much and get a dry throat and/or nosebleeds.","score":1,"comments":[{"body":"","score":0,"comments":[]}]},{"body":"","score":0,"comments":[]}]},{"title":"How to stop this toilet from running? , sounds like dripping water constantly and it half flushes intermittently","not_safe_for_work":false,"locked":false,"body":"","score":1,"comments":[{"body":"OP needs to replace the internals to his/her toilet!\n\nIt‚Äôs an easy job, &amp; can legit be learned by spending 5-10 minutes on YouTube.\n\nIf you want to try an easy half azzz fix just replace the plunger that blocks your water off at the bottom &amp; hope it‚Äôs a leaky seal.\n\nDoesn‚Äôt sound that way though","score":2,"comments":[]},{"body":"I'm no expert but is that blue hose damaged? it looks like it's damaged towards the far side and I see droplets clinging to it near there and the area around.\n\nEDIT: thanks for that whoever downvoted, if I'm wrong you could just, like, correct me","score":2,"comments":[{"body":"Hmm I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the hose , though it does look cracked here!

The seal at the bottom could be leaking, as you mentioned. For me, it was the float that triggers the water supply, which wasn't fully returning to position and therefore allowing a trickle of water through. Those flush units are fairly low-cost and easy enough to replace with basic tools.
