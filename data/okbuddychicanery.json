{"name":"okbuddychicanery","description":"A subreddit for ironic memes of the Breaking Bad Universe shows","subscribers":214561,"posts":[{"title":"OKBUDDYCHICANERY UPDATE LOG ‚ÄºÔ∏è (okbc mods try not to party poop challenge (impossible))","not_safe_for_work":false,"locked":false,"body":"Hello okbuddychicanery, it's me, your favorite mod, here to announce half of the content being posted is banned (I know you all love it when we do this)\nRecently, there's been an influx of lazy and unfunny posts flooding the sub, and since we are big brother 1984, we're trying to actually make the sub not an effortless lifeless subreddit where people just karma farm.\n\nHERE ARE THE FORMATS BANNED FROM THE SUB FROM NOW ON:\n\n-- **Screenshots from r/bettercallsaul or r/breakingbad are banned.** Yeah, I know we all love making fun of lame ass motherfuckers saying stupid shit, but now it's just anything anyone says on that sub that gets posted. It encourages people to make alts and post stupid shit on there just to post it here, which is something we do not condone. That's annoying on its own, but there's also the fact that names aren't even being censored on the posts, which can lead to harrassment of the original posters. We're a shitpost sub, not a r/breakingbad or r/bettercallsaul hate sub. Stop acting like it is, post actual shitposts instead.\n\n-- **Lazy, effortless karma farming posts are banned.** Some posts are unfunny, sure, but some of the things that reach the front page aren't even trying. Posts that are just asking people things are banned, if there isn't any joke behind it. This isn't referring to questions like \"Why are the Mexican characters called Nacho and Taco?\" but more referring to the obviously effortless \"What would you do if you were transported to ....\" \"What would you do if you were called by ....\" maybe you should consider what you would do if a woman started talking to you. These posts are inherently just karma farming and if there are no jokes whatsoever in the post itself, it will get removed. This rule is in reference to other different kinds of posts as well, but this is the most common form of it. It's not hard to tell what posts fall under this category; this rule doesn't cover posts that are trying to be funny but aren't, it just covers the ones that are just not funny.\n\nUnfortunately we aren't banning formats like Mandela effect and Heisenbones, shitpost formats that get repetitive usually get filtered out on their own. Have an A1 day! üòÅ\n\nEDIT: Posts about Twitter or YouTube posts are only allowed if the names are censored and are not intended to harrass people. Otherwise they fall under the scope of the first rule.","score":515,"comments":[{"body":"1216","score":431,"comments":[{"body":"Are u sure?

Jesse is a \"blowfish\" because he didn't kill a man but everyone thinks he did (notice as well that he wears a jack-o-lantern shirt, a scary face that's ultimately hollow inside). Meanwhile, Hank killed a man, but no one in the new DEA unit believes he had the chops, chalking up his presence there as mere \"politics\".\n\nIt brings us back to the age old question: is it better to have sex with a goat, or to have everyone believe that you did?  Now personally for me, it depends on what level of protection I'm afforded, but that's neither here nor there. What was I talking about?\n\nOh right, both Hank and Jesse experience life-altering trauma after the killings -- Hank's tough guy exterior breaks down, while Jesse turtles up in his house to abuse drugs in escapism. Speaking of turtles, did you see that explosion? Holy crap that was just like KALBLOOM and yet Hank, even after feeling woozy and being derided by his peers, jumps right into action, tightening up his colleague's blown off leg to stall the bleeding.\n\nAlso, completely unrelated but definitely worth a mention, Skyler making the mistake of buying Walt Jr Raisin Bran instead of Raisin Bran Crunch represents the neglect that those with disabilities have to face on a day to day basis everyday, invisible to others. Skyler didn't see the crunch, just like you might not notice the lack of an entrance ramp to a building, but those with a walking impairment would be strongly hampered by it. Skyler is offended by Jr's insistence that the \"crunch\" is important, but I think it's important for all of us to be conscious of accessibility issues that go unseen to most of us, but are a major daily hurdle to a select few.","score":1,"comments":[]},{"body":"very boring episode aside from the hank plot","score":1,"comments":[]}]},{"title":"My bacon kind of looks like bitch wife‚Äôs vagina","not_safe_for_work":false,"locked":false,"body":"","score":10,"comments":[{"body":"ü§¢","score":5,"comments":[]},{"body":"how do you even know what bitch wife's vagina looks like if it was never seen in the show?","score":7,"comments":[{"body":"It‚Äôs put on full display in AMC‚Äôs new show Better Rim Kim.

And I'd get called out on Trials all the time, hundreds probably over the years.\n\nBut there was this one guy, this one piece of shit, that I will never forget. LyleHermanos4, he was playing Nea, you remember her? Noob3's favourite survivor? You don't remember? Anyway, big player. Red ranked. But his friend, whatever they were, his SWF... Was in brown ranks. Played like a baby. Looped like they were drunk.\n\nAnyway, me and my stream chat got called out there every weekend, and one of us would pull them aside and say \"come on, tonight's the night you unfriend him\". And this wasn't one of those \"It's just banter, he's not really toxic\" setups, we get a lot of those, but not this.\n\nThis friend was scared. They weren't going to cross him, no way, no how. Nothing we could do but be nice to them in postgame chat, drag him on stream, report his profile. He waits out the ban, next week out he goes. Back to SWF.\n\nBut one night, I'm playing off stream, it's just me. And the match comes in and it's the usual crap. Sandbagged them, then stopped repairing gens to wait for his team to die and get hatch. So I report him, finish the match, and away we go. Only that night, we're in postgame chat and this sideways asshole is looking at a 3K hatch escape and says \"gg ez\". And it just rubbed me wrong.\n\nSo instead of leaving, I get his IP address, out of nowhere. And I friend request him, and I sent him a picture of his house, and I told him \"This is it. This is how it ends.\" And he's crying, going to the bathroom all over himself, swearing to god he'll quit DbD. Screaming... As much as you can over chat. And I told him to be quiet. Cause I needed to think about what I was gonna do here. \n\nAnd of course he got quiet. Quit out of the game. And real quiet. Like a dog waiting for dinner scraps. And we just stood there for a while, me acting like I'm thinking things over, and Prince Charming sweating in front of his PC with shit in his pants. And after a few minutes I deleted the draft of my tweet to doxx him, and I say \"So help me if you play SWF with them again I will such and such, and such and such, blah blah blah.\"\n\nJust trying to do the right thing. But two weeks later he'd taken over his friend's account. Of course. Got em with a phishing email. We got there, there were so many Counter-Strike skins he had sold off that profile, you could arm a country.\n\nThe moral of the story is: I chose a half-measure, when I should have gone all the way.
